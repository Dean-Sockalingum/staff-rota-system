## Risk Assessment for Inspection

### **High-Risk Areas (Requires Mitigation):**

🔴 **Risk 1: Resident/Family Feedback Integration**
- **Issue:** No systematic surveys or complaint tracking currently
- **Impact:** Cannot demonstrate person-centered QI involvement
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Interim: Gather manual feedback at care reviews, document in evidence pack
  - Long-term: TQM Feedback module (Q3 2026)
- **Residual Risk:** MEDIUM (gap acknowledged, credible plan)

🔴 **Risk 2: Incident Root Cause Analysis**
- **Issue:** Basic incident visualization, no RCA or SPSP alignment
- **Impact:** Limited learning from incidents, safety culture unclear
- **Mitigation:**
  - Interim: Conduct manual RCA for recent incidents, show process
  - Long-term: TQM Incident Management module (Q3 2026)
- **Residual Risk:** MEDIUM (current practice exists, not integrated)

🔴 **Risk 3: Care Plan Integration**
- **Issue:** No direct link to care planning systems
- **Impact:** Person-centered planning not directly evidenced
- **Mitigation:**
  - Interim: Emphasize staffing adequacy enabling care planning time
  - Long-term: Care plan API integration (Phase 5 - 2027)
- **Residual Risk:** MEDIUM (acknowledge limitation, focus on staffing support)

### **Medium-Risk Areas (Monitor):**

🟡 **Risk 4: Board Governance Documentation**
- **Issue:** Quality oversight evident but formal schedule/minutes unclear
- **Impact:** Leadership accountability loop not fully demonstrated
- **Mitigation:** Document board review schedule, provide sample minutes (Q1 2026)
- **Residual Risk:** LOW (quick fix, evidence available)

🟡 **Risk 5: Facilities Management**
- **Issue:** Limited Setting theme coverage (40/100 score)
- **Impact:** Environmental quality not evidenced
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Acknowledge: Rota system focus is staffing, not facilities
  - Show: Housekeeping/Maintenance scheduling ensures basic coverage
  - Plan: Facilities module in future roadmap (Phase 5)
- **Residual Risk:** LOW (expectations aligned with system scope)

### **Low-Risk Areas (Well-Managed):**

🟢 **Training Compliance:** 0% lapsed certifications, 18 courses tracked = EXCELLENT  
🟢 **Data-Driven Leadership:** £590K ROI, automated reports, CI Dashboard = EXCELLENT  
🟢 **Staff Support:** Fair allocation, 85% mobile adoption, AI assistant = VERY GOOD  
🟢 **Evidence Generation:** 80% reduction in prep time (40 hrs → 8 hrs) = VERY GOOD

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Dean Sockalingum  
**Review Date:** February 2026 (post-presentation, post-manager UAT)  
**Status:** Phase 3 Task 5 Complete ✅

**Next Inspection Readiness Review:** Q2 2026 (following TQM Quality Audits module deployment)

**Overall Assessment:** System demonstrates GOOD inspection readiness (72/100) with clear pathway to VERY GOOD (95+) by Q4 2026 through systematic TQM module deployment and evidence enhancement. Critical gaps identified with credible mitigation plans. Leadership, Staff, and Care & Support themes show strong foundations requiring targeted enhancements. Wellbeing and Setting themes have acknowledged gaps with long-term development roadmap.
