- Clash detection and management

## Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|

---

## Annual Leave Entitlements

### Standard Entitlements

**Full-Time Staff (37.5 hours/week):**
- **Years 0-5:** 28 days (including 8 public holidays)
- **Years 5-10:** 31 days (including 8 public holidays)
- **Years 10+:** 34 days (including 8 public holidays)

**Part-Time Staff:**
- Pro-rata based on contracted hours
- Example: 20 hours/week = 53% of full-time = 14.84 days (Years 0-5)

**Public Holidays:**
- 8 days included in entitlement (New Year, Easter, May Day, Summer, Christmas, Boxing Day, etc.)
- If working public holiday: Time off in lieu (TOIL) added

---

### Pro-Rata Calculations

**Mid-Year Starters:**

System auto-calculates based on:
```
Start Date: 15 June 2025
Days Remaining in Year: 200 days (approx 6.5 months)
Full Entitlement: 28 days
Pro-Rata: (200/365) × 28 = 15.34 days (rounds to 15 days)
```

**Leavers:**

Entitlement calculated to leaving date:
```
Leaving Date: 31 August 2025
Days Worked: 242 days (approx 8 months)
Used: 12 days
Entitlement: (242/365) × 28 = 18.56 days
Owed: 18.56 - 12 = 6.56 days (paid out with final salary)
```

---

### Carry-Over Rules

**Standard Policy:**
- Maximum 5 days carry-over to next year
- Must be used by 31 March of new year
- Requires manager approval
- Exceptional circumstances: Up to 10 days with HR approval

**Why Limit Carry-Over?**
- Prevents staff exhaustion (not taking breaks)
- Ensures regular time off for wellbeing
- Avoids large liability on accounts
- Employment law best practice

---

## Procedure: Requesting Annual Leave

### Step 1: Check Your Leave Balance

**Method A: Dashboard**

1. Log in to system
2. Dashboard shows: **"Annual Leave Balance: 14.5 days"**
3. Click for detailed breakdown:
   ```
   Total Entitlement: 28 days
   Used: 8 days
   Booked: 5.5 days
   Remaining: 14.5 days
   Carry-Over from Last Year: 3 days (must use by 31 March)
   ```

**Method B: Annual Leave Page**

1. Navigate to **"Annual Leave"** in main menu
2. See full year calendar with:
   - Green = Leave approved
   - Orange = Leave pending
   - Gray = Public holidays
   - Red = Unit closure days

**Method C: AI Assistant**

- Ask: **"How many leave days do I have left?"**
- Or: **"What's my annual leave balance?"**
- Or: **"When did I last take leave?"**

---

### Step 2: Plan Your Leave Request

**Best Practices:**

✅ **DO:**
- Request at least 4 weeks in advance (non-urgent)
- Request 8+ weeks for peak periods (summer, Christmas)
- Check team calendar first (avoid clashes)
- Request full weeks when possible (easier cover)
- Spread leave throughout year (don't save all for December)
- Use carry-over by 31 March deadline

❌ **DON'T:**
- Request last-minute (less than 2 weeks = may be declined)
- Request >2 weeks continuous leave (max usually 10 working days)
- Request same dates as multiple colleagues
- Save all leave for end of year
- Forget about public holidays (already included in entitlement)

---

### Step 3: Submit Leave Request

1. **Navigate to Annual Leave → Request Leave**

2. **Fill in Request Form**
   ```
   Required Fields:
   - Start Date: [DD/MM/YYYY]
   - End Date: [DD/MM/YYYY]
   - Total Days: [Auto-calculated, e.g., 5 days]
   - Leave Type: Annual Leave / Carry-Over / TOIL
   - Reason: [Optional but helpful, e.g., "Family holiday abroad"]
   - Emergency Contact: [Phone number while on leave]
   ```

3. **System Checks**
   
   **✅ Passed:**
   - Sufficient balance available
   - No clash with other approved requests
   - Within notice period
   - Not exceeding maximum continuous days

   **⚠️ Warnings:**
   - "Low staffing level on these dates"
   - "You have [X] carry-over days to use by 31 March"
   - "This will exceed recommended 60% usage by this date"

   **❌ Blocked:**
   - Insufficient balance
   - Unit closure day (compulsory leave)
   - >3 staff already approved for same dates
   - Less than 14 days notice (unless emergency)

4. **Submit Request**
   - Click **"Submit Leave Request"**

|--------|---------|--------|
| **Pending** | Awaiting manager decision | Wait (usually 48 hours) |
| **Approved** | ✅ Leave confirmed | Added to rota, enjoy your time off! |
| **Declined** | ❌ Cannot be granted | See reason, try alternative dates |
| **Cancelled** | You cancelled request | Can request different dates |

**Checking Status:**

1. **Dashboard Alert:** Shows pending requests
2. **Annual Leave Page:** Lists all requests with status
3. **Email Notification:** When status changes
4. **AI Assistant:** Ask "What's the status of my leave request?"

---

### Step 5: If Declined

**Common Reasons:**

- Insufficient staffing on requested dates
- Too many colleagues already booked
- Less than required notice period
- Exceeds maximum continuous days
- Unit closure day conflicts

**What to Do:**

1. **Read Manager's Comments**
   - Click on declined request
   - Manager explains reason
   - May suggest alternative dates

2. **Request Alternative Dates**
   - Submit new request for different dates
   - Or discuss with manager directly
   - Compromise if possible

3. **If Urgent/Emergency:**
   - Speak to manager in person
   - Explain circumstances
   - Manager may grant exception

---

## Procedure: Approving Leave Requests (Managers)

### Step 1: Receive Request Notification

**Notifications:**
- Email: "New leave request from [Staff Name]"
- Dashboard alert: "3 leave requests pending"
- System notification badge

---

### Step 2: Review Request

**Access Pending Requests:**

1. Navigate to **Annual Leave → Approve Requests**
2. See list of pending requests with details:
   ```
   Staff Member: J. Smith
   Dates: 15-19 July 2025 (5 days)
   Reason: Family holiday
   Balance: 14.5 days available
   Status: Pending since 2 days ago
   ```

3. **Click "Review" to See Full Details**

---

### Step 3: Check Staffing Levels

**System Shows:**

```
Staffing Impact Analysis

Dates: 15-19 July 2025
Unit: DEMENTIA

Current Approved Leave:
- K. Brown: 15-16 July (2 days) ✅ Approved
- M. Miller: 17 July (1 day) ✅ Approved

If This Request Approved:
- 15-16 July: 2 staff on leave (staffing 85% - ACCEPTABLE)
- 17 July: 2 staff on leave (staffing 85% - ACCEPTABLE)
- 18-19 July: 1 staff on leave (staffing 93% - GOOD)

Recommendation: ✅ SAFE TO APPROVE
```

**Staffing Thresholds:**
- 🟢 **Green (>90%):** Safe to approve
- 🟡 **Yellow (80-90%):** Caution - check carefully
- 🔴 **Red (<80%):** Unsafe - decline or negotiate dates

---

### Step 4: Make Decision

**Option A: Approve**

1. Click **"Approve"** button
2. Optional: Add comment ("Enjoy your holiday!")
3. Confirm approval
4. **System Actions:**
   - Status → Approved
   - Deducts days from balance
   - Adds to rota (marked as "Annual Leave")
   - Emails staff confirmation
   - Updates staffing reports

**Option B: Decline**

1. Click **"Decline"** button
2. **Must add reason** (mandatory):
   - Example: "Sorry, we already have 3 staff on leave those dates. Can you take 22-26 July instead?"
3. Confirm decline
4. **System Actions:**
   - Status → Declined
   - Emails staff with your reason
   - Days not deducted from balance
   - Staff can request alternative dates

**Option C: Request More Info**

1. Click **"Message Staff Member"**
2. Ask question (e.g., "Can you do 16-20 July instead of 15-19?")
3. Status remains Pending
4. Staff replies via system
5. Then approve or decline

---

### Step 5: Approval Timeline

**Service Level:**
- Routine requests (4+ weeks notice): Respond within 2 working days
- Short notice (2-4 weeks): Respond within 24 hours
- Emergency (<2 weeks): Respond same day if possible

**If You Can't Decide:**
- Discuss with senior manager
- Consider alternative arrangements (e.g., part-time cover)
- Negotiate with staff (different dates, fewer days)
- Don't leave requests pending >5 days (unfair to staff)

---

## Leave Usage Targets

### Why Monitor Usage?

**Benefits:**
- Ensures staff take regular breaks (wellbeing)
- Prevents burnout
- Identifies staff not taking leave (may indicate problems)
- Avoids year-end rush (everyone wanting December off)
- Spreads leave throughout year (easier to cover)

---

### Target Usage by Quarter

**Recommended Pattern:**

| Quarter | Months | Target Usage | Typical Actual |
|---------|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Q1** | Jan-Mar | 25% (7 days) | 20% (carry-over use) |
| **Q2** | Apr-Jun | 50% (14 days) | 45% (Easter, spring) |
| **Q3** | Jul-Sep | 75% (21 days) | 65% (summer holidays) |
| **Q4** | Oct-Dec | 100% (28 days) | 85% (Christmas rush) |

**System Alerts:**

- **Green:** On track (±5% of target)
- **Yellow:** Falling behind (>10% under target)
- **Red:** At risk (<50% used by September)

---

### Leave Usage Dashboard

**For Staff:**

1. Navigate to **Annual Leave → My Usage**
2. See chart showing:
   ```
   Your Leave Usage: 45% (12.6 days used of 28)
   Target by Now (June): 50% (14 days)
   Status: 🟡 Slightly Behind - Book 2-3 days soon
   ```

3. **Recommendations:**
   - "Book leave for July or August to catch up"
   - "You have 3 days carry-over - use by 31 March"
   - "Consider booking week around summer public holiday"

**For Managers:**

1. Navigate to **Annual Leave → Team Usage**
2. See all staff with usage %:
   ```
   J. Smith: 65% ✅ On track
   K. Brown: 40% 🟡 Behind - encourage booking
   M. Miller: 85% ✅ Ahead of target
   L. Wilson: 15% 🔴 Critical - must book leave urgently
   ```

3. **Action Required:**
   - Contact L. Wilson: "You've only used 15% of leave - is everything OK?"
   - May indicate: Workload issues, personal problems, fear of taking time off
   - Encourage/require leave booking: "Please book at least 1 week by end of month"

---

## Special Leave Scenarios

### Compassionate Leave

**Not annual leave - separate entitlement:**
- Bereavement: 3-5 days paid
- Serious family illness: Up to 5 days paid
- Emergency domestic: 1-2 days paid

**How to Request:**
- Mark as "Compassionate Leave" not "Annual Leave"
- Doesn't deduct from annual leave balance
- Requires evidence (funeral details, hospital admission, etc.)
- Manager approval required but usually granted

---

### Parental Leave

**Maternity/Paternity Leave:**
- Separate statutory entitlement
- Not annual leave
- Managed through HR, not this system

**Annual Leave During Mat/Pat Leave:**
- Continue to accrue annual leave while on mat/pat leave
- Can be taken before or after mat/pat leave
- Or paid out if not taken

---

### Sick Leave

**If Sick While on Annual Leave:**

1. **Notify Manager Immediately**
   - Call/text as soon as unwell
   - Explain illness

2. **Provide Sick Note** (if >7 days)
   - GP sick note
   - Emailed to manager and HR

3. **Leave Days Returned**
   - System converts leave days to sick leave
   - Annual leave days returned to balance
   - Can rebook those days later

**Example:**
```
Booked: 10-14 June (5 days annual leave)
Sick: 12-14 June (3 days)
Result: 10-11 June = Annual leave (2 days used)
        12-14 June = Sick leave (3 days returned to balance)
Remaining Balance: +3 days
```

---

### Time Off In Lieu (TOIL)

**Earned When:**
- Working on public holiday
- Extra hours for on-call/emergency
- Approved by manager

**How to Use:**
1. TOIL hours added to balance (separate from annual leave)
2. Request leave as "TOIL" not "Annual Leave"
3. Usually must be used within 3 months
4. Cannot be carried over to next year
5. Not paid out if unused (use it or lose it)

---

## Year-End Procedures

### October: Year-End Planning

**For Managers:**

1. **Run Leave Usage Report**

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Insufficient balance" error

**Cause:** Trying to book more days than available

**Solution:**
1. Check your balance (Dashboard or Annual Leave page)
2. Reduce number of days requested
3. Or wait until new year when balance resets

---

### Issue: Request showing as Pending for >1 week

**Cause:** Manager hasn't reviewed yet

**Solution:**
1. Speak to manager directly
2. Send polite reminder: "Could you review my leave request when you have a moment?"
3. If urgent and manager unavailable: Contact senior manager
4. Check request hasn't gone to spam (if manager uses email notifications)

---

### Issue: Need to cancel approved leave

**Situation:** Leave approved but plans changed

**Solution:**
1. Navigate to Annual Leave → My Requests
2. Find approved request
3. Click **"Cancel Request"**
4. Add reason: "Plans changed - will rebook later"
5. Days returned to balance immediately
6. Notify manager (courtesy)

**Deadline:** Can cancel up to day before leave starts

---

### Issue: Wrong dates booked

**Solution:**
1. Cancel incorrect request
2. Submit new request with correct dates
3. Or contact manager to amend manually
4. Check system calendar to avoid mistakes

---

### Issue: Public holiday not recognized

**Cause:** Working on public holiday but system didn't give TOIL

**Solution:**
1. Contact manager/HR
2. Manual TOIL adjustment required
3. System admin adds TOIL hours to your balance
4. You can then use as leave later
