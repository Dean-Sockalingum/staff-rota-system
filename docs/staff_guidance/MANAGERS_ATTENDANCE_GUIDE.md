## Introduction

### Our Policy

Every day, our employees act as the 'face' of Glasgow City Council, often coming into contact with the people who live in and visit the City. Our reputation and success depends on the services we deliver. **We expect a high level of attendance from employees** in order to deliver an efficient and effective service to all our customers.

We recognise the importance of the health, safety and wellbeing of all employees. Our **Supporting Attendance Policy** provides a framework which allows us to:

- ✅ Support employees' attendance
- ✅ Provide assistance to employees with health problems at an early stage
- ✅ Demonstrate our commitment through professional services (EAP, Occupational Health)

### Purpose of This Guide

This guide outlines:

1. **Your responsibilities** as a manager under our policy
2. **Processes to follow** when an employee reports absent due to sickness
3. **Support you should consider** to help employees return to work
4. **Steps to take** where attendance is giving cause for concern
5. **Actions required** where an employee is unable to return to work

### Required Training

As an introduction to managing attendance, you should complete the e-learning course:

📚 **"Maximizing Attendance – Effective Communication"**

This ensures employees are managed in line with Council policy and procedures.

## Why Manage Attendance?

Sickness Absence is one of the Council's **Statutory Performance Indicators** and is used for benchmarking and performance review.

### The Cost of Poor Attendance Management

High levels of sickness absence are costly. If you don't manage attendance properly, it could:

| Impact Area | Consequences |
|------------|--------------|
| **Service Delivery** | Detrimental impact on support provided to citizens who rely on Council services |
| **Reputation** | Damage to Council's public image and trust |
| **Staff Morale** | Additional pressures affecting morale, stress levels, and engagement |
| **Culture** | Staff with intermittent absences may think it's acceptable to be absent regardless of circumstances |
| **Long-term Absent Staff** | Employees feeling cut off, out of touch, and isolated |

### The Benefits of Proactive Attendance Management

Taking an active role in managing attendance allows you to:

- ✅ **Support employees** with health problems at an early stage
- ✅ **Create a wellbeing culture** across the Council
- ✅ **Respond effectively** to service delivery problems
- ✅ **Reduce impact** on colleagues who continue to provide services
- ✅ **Increase productivity** through early intervention
- ✅ **Reduce costs** associated with absence
- ✅ **Plan workloads** more effectively
- ✅ **Improve customer satisfaction** through consistent service

### The Importance of Early Discussions

Adopting a proactive approach requires **open and honest discussions** about health conditions affecting employees' ability to perform their duties. Ensuring discussions take place at an early stage:

- Identifies adjustments that could support staff
- Delivers improved employee health and wellbeing
- Provides the right help and support when needed
- Enables better planning and workload management

Our occupational health service is provided independently by **People Asset Management (PAM)** to help promote and maintain the health, safety and wellbeing of all employees.

### What OH Can Help With

- ✅ Determining fitness to work
- ✅ Supporting employees with health problems
- ✅ Assisting employees returning to work after illness or injury

### Assessing When to Make a Referral

Consider an OH referral if:

- 🔴 Employee's health may be affecting their performance or attendance at work

### Before Making a Referral

Gather as much information as possible from the employee about:

- 🩺 The nature of their illness or disability
- ⏰ How long the absence is likely to last
- 🔄 Whether they're likely to make a full recovery
- 💼 What work they're able to do
- 📋 Job and working conditions
- 📊 Sickness absence history

### When a Referral May Not Be Needed (Early Stages)

You may **not** need to refer immediately where:

- Employee provides clear information about their treatment plan
- Hospital consultation is scheduled soon (wait for updated information)
- Employee indicates they'll be fit to return within a particular timeframe

**However:** Where absence reaches **8-12 weeks** with no expected return date, a referral should be considered.

### OH Advice Line

**Phone:** 0141 428 3900

Get general medical guidance from an occupational health practitioner. Contact the advice line if you're unsure whether a referral is necessary.

📖 **More information:** Supporting Attendance: OHS Guide for Managers

### Making a Referral

You should refer an employee to OH to:

1. Clarify when they'll be able to return to work
2. Establish what duties they can carry out

**Important:** Tell the employee you're referring them and explain why **before** making the referral.

### Referral Process

Referrals are made via the Council's **OH portal – OHIO**. If you don't have access to OHIO, contact your Service Strategic HR team.

**More details:** Supporting Attendance: Making Referrals Using OHIO

### What to Include in the Referral

Provide details about the employee's:

- Nature of illness or disability
- Expected duration of absence
- Likelihood of full recovery
- Job and working conditions
- Sickness absence history

**Note:** Ensure information is accurate and up-to-date, as the employee can access this form.

📖 **More information:** Supporting Attendance: Manager's Guide to Disability, Mental Health Problems and Stress

### The Consultation Appointment

- Appointments may be conducted by **telephone or face-to-face** as clinically appropriate
- Employee must participate in the consultation with a nurse or doctor

### Third Party Medical Reports

Occasionally, up-to-date medical information may be needed from an employee's GP and/or hospital specialist when:

- Employee isn't well enough to take part in the appointment process
- OH Adviser or Physician requires additional information

**Employee consent is required** and OH will send a consent form in accordance with General Medical Council guidelines.

- Answers to your questions

**Your responsibilities:**

1. Provide a copy of the report to the employee

---

## Absence Reporting

### Reporting Absent (Day 1)

If an employee is ill and can't attend work, they **must contact you as soon as possible** on the first day.

#### How to Report

- ☎️ **Direct telephone contact** with you
- 📞 **Leave a message** with contact details if you're unavailable
- ❌ **Only in exceptional circumstances** (e.g., hospital admission) may a family member/friend contact on their behalf

#### If You're Unavailable

Where you've been unavailable and the employee has:

- Left a message with a colleague
- Left a recorded message on answerphone
- Sent an email or text message

**You should make a return call at the earliest opportunity**

### Questions You Should Ask (Day 1 Call)

When an employee reports sick, establish the current situation by asking:

| Question | Why It's Important |
|----------|-------------------|
| **What is the reason for the absence?** | Understand the nature of the issue |
| **What is the expected duration?** | Plan coverage and support |
| **Has medical advice been sought?** | Determine severity and next steps |
| **Is there anything you can do to help?** | Offer immediate support |
| **Are there any workplace issues contributing?** | Identify work-related causes |
| **Any outstanding work items, tasks, or upcoming meetings?** | Ensure business continuity |
| **What is their expected return date if known?** | Plan workload and coverage |
| **Are further supports required (e.g., EAP)?** | Connect to appropriate resources |

**Also ask:** Is there anything else you need to make me aware of?

**Confirm:** When they should next make contact

### Consider a Wellbeing Support Meeting

For absences due to **musculoskeletal or psychological conditions**, consider arranging a Wellbeing Support Meeting within the **first week** to establish what support can be offered.

---

## Continuing Sickness Absence

### Maintaining Contact (Days 4, 7, and Beyond)

| Timeline | Employee Must | Details |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Day 4** | Contact you | Based on calendar days, not workdays |
| **Day 7** | Contact you + submit fit note if absence continues | Next available working day if Day 7 falls on non-working day |
| **Beyond 7 days** | Contact you every 7 days + submit ongoing fit notes | Maintain regular contact |

### Local Arrangements

Local arrangements for reporting (e.g., phoning within the first hour of shift) should be made clear to the employee and may be in place for non-standard working patterns.

### If Employee Doesn't Maintain Contact

If the employee doesn't maintain contact or submit medical statements on time:

- ⚠️ Absence may be considered **unauthorised**
- ⚠️ May result in **Occupational Sick Pay entitlement being suspended**

### Your Duty of Care

As a line manager, you have a duty of care toward your employees. Take **all reasonable management steps** to ensure no safety or welfare issues are causing non-contact:

1. Attempt to contact by telephone
2. Contact employee's next of kin
3. Visit employee's home (if appropriate)

### Extended Absence Circumstances

In some circumstances, an employee may have a condition that will result in an extended absence. **Discuss and agree appropriate contact arrangements** in such cases (e.g., less frequent contact if treatment plan is known).

### Summary of Reporting Process

```
Day 1: Employee MUST tell you immediately if they're sick
       ↓
Day 4: If still sick, employee MUST tell you and indicate if absence 
       likely to continue beyond 7 days
       ↓
Day 7: If still sick, employee MUST tell you and provide update
       [If able to return within 7 days → complete sickness absence certificate on return]
       ↓
Day 8+: If absent for more than 7 days, employee MUST submit a fit note
        for the relevant period
        ↓
Day 14+: Employee MUST contact you every 7 days and provide updates
         [Upon return, submit sickness absence certificate for first 7 days]
```

---

## Self-Certification

### Absences Less Than 7 Calendar Days

Where an absence is **less than 7 calendar days**, an employee should complete a **Sickness Absence Certificate** (also known as 'self-certification').

**When:** Completed by the employee as part of the return to work discussion  
**Storage:** Kept in their employee file

---

## The Statement of Fitness for Work ("Fit Note")

The employee needs to submit a copy of **Statement of Fitness for Work** (commonly known as a "fit note") after the **7th calendar day** of absence.

### Two Types of Assessment

| Assessment | Meaning | Actions |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Not fit for work** | Employee has a health condition preventing them from working for a stated period | Cover duties; maintain contact; plan for return |
| **May be fit for work** | Employee has a condition that doesn't necessarily stop them from returning, but may not be able to do all normal duties | Discuss adjustments; consider temporary modifications; phased return options |

### "May Be Fit for Work" Options

If the fit note says "may be fit for work," it will note whether the employee would benefit from:

- 🔄 **Phased return to work** - Gradual increase in hours/days
- ⏰ **Altered hours** - Different start/end times or reduced hours
- 📝 **Amended duties** - Temporary change to job tasks
- 🏢 **Workplace adaptations** - Environmental or equipment changes

### GP Comments

The GP or authorized healthcare professional will:

- Provide **written comments** offering a detailed view of what may help
- Explain how the condition affects what the employee can do
- Suggest things that could help the employee return to work
- State the **period of time** the advice is valid for

### Discussing the Fit Note

You should:

1. Discuss the fit note with the employee
2. Be clear about the length of time any amended duties or support will be in place
3. Note that this will be a **temporary measure** in most cases
4. Meet with the employee while they're doing adjusted duties to review progress

### When the Fit Note Expires

The fit note doesn't include an option for the GP to advise that the employee is "fully fit for work." This means **an employee is expected to return to work following expiration of their fit note**.

### Early Return to Work

If an employee wants to return to work **before the end of the fit note period** and you agree it's appropriate, **you don't need to wait** until the end of the statement period.

**However:** If you don't think it's appropriate, you may wish to seek guidance from:

- **OH Advice Line:** 0141 428 3900
- **Your Service Strategic HR team**

📖 **More information:** Supporting Attendance: Occupational Health Service Guide for Managers

---

## During Long Term Absence

The employee **must maintain regular contact** during any continuing period of sickness absence.

### Why Regular Contact is Important

Regular contact ensures:

- ✅ Employee has opportunity to update you on their health situation
- ✅ You can offer appropriate help and support to aid return to work
- ✅ You can keep employee up-to-date with work developments or changes
- ✅ You can advise employee of any management decisions regarding their attendance

### Meeting Frequency

You should arrange to meet with the employee **regularly on a face-to-face basis** during their absence:

- **Typically every 4-6 weeks** unless deemed inappropriate
- **Weekly telephone contact** for updates

### When Meetings May Be Inappropriate

For example:

- Employee is undergoing treatment for long-term illness
- Meeting may impact negatively on their health

### Occupational Sick Pay

Employees may receive full and half pay, each up to a **maximum of 26 weeks**, depending on their length of service.

**Note:** Previous absences within the rolling year will be taken into consideration.

📖 **More information:** Sickness Absence: Leave and Pay Condition of Service

---

## Return to Work Discussions

### When Required

In line with policy, you are **required** to carry out a return to work discussion when an employee returns to work **after any period of absence**.

**Timing:** Normally on the **day of their return**

### Before the Meeting

You should have:

- ✅ Details of the employee's attendance record
- ✅ Familiarity with our policy
- ✅ Knowledge of the thresholds for an attendance review

### Purpose of the Return to Work Discussion

The return to work discussion allows you to:

| Purpose | What to Do |
|---------|-----------|
| **Welcome back** | Confirm they're fit to be back at work |
| **Confirm and discuss** | Nature and reason for absence; likelihood of recurrence |
| **Offer support** | Provide relevant help and support |
| **Update** | Inform about developments or changes during their absence |
| **Confirm further action** | E.g., Wellbeing Support Meeting or OH referral |
| **Advise consequences** | Where attendance is giving cause for concern and reaching unsustainable level |
| **Agree actions** | If necessary, agree actions to improve attendance |
| **Complete forms** | Ensure sickness certificate form (self-certification) is completed where appropriate |

### Employee Rights

**Note:** Although this is an informal meeting which does not require notification in writing, an employee has the **right to be accompanied** by a colleague or trade union representative.

### Self Certification Form (Return to Work Form)

The purpose of the return to work form is to:

- Record details of the employee's absence
- Confirm they're fit to be back at work

**Process:**

1. Both you and the employee complete relevant sections at the meeting
2. Record whether you intend to take further action (e.g., arrange Attendance Review)
3. Both you and the employee sign the form
4. Scan and send to CBS to be kept in the employee's personal file

### Claims Against a Third Party

In cases where an employee has been absent due to an injury involving a third party (e.g., whiplash following road traffic accident):

- Ask whether they intend to make a claim against a third party
- Record these details on the sickness absence certificate

**Important:** If the employee successfully pursues a claim, the Council expects to be **reimbursed for all sickness allowance paid** for that absence.

---

## Managing Attendance

### Absence Categories and Equality Act Considerations

There are **two categories** of sickness absence within our policy:

| Category | Definition | Examples |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Short Term Intermittent Absence** | Any period of sickness absence up to 19 days | Can include absences covered by sickness absence certificate and/or fit note |
| **Long Term Absence** | Any period of absence lasting over 19 days | Extended illness, surgery recovery, long-term health conditions |

### Equality Act 2010 Requirements

Throughout the supporting attendance process, when managing either category of absence, managers **must be mindful** of the requirements of the **Equality Act 2010 (Amendment) Regulations 2023**.

The Act makes specific provisions to prevent discrimination against any employee on the grounds of a **protected characteristic**. Of particular relevance to attendance is **"disability"**.

### Definition of Disability Under the Equality Act 2010

A person is disabled if they have:

**"A physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities"**

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Impairment** | May be physical or mental, or both |
| **Long-term** | Lasting at least a year, or likely to be for the rest of the person's life, or recur |
| **Substantial adverse effect** | More than minor, but may fluctuate or change, and may not be present all the time |
| **Normal day-to-day activities** | Not defined by the Act, but includes things people do in their own time; still able to fully participate in working life |

### Complex Cases

Managing disability-related sickness absence can be complex. **Consult with your Service Strategic HR teams** in relation to such situations.

📖 **More information:** Equalities Library

### Types of Absence

In certain situations, the nature of an employee's absence will determine how you should manage it. Additional guidance is available for absences due to:

- 🤰 Pregnancy
- 🍺 Alcohol and drugs
- 💥 Violence at work
- 🧠 Disability, mental health problems, or stress

## Wellbeing Support Meeting

### What is a Wellbeing Support Meeting?

A Wellbeing Support Meeting is about **identifying supports and providing assistance** at the earliest possible stage of absence.

**Key principle:** Meeting with an employee in the early stages can:

- ✅ Increase likelihood of full recovery
- ✅ Shorten the period of absence

### When is it Appropriate?

Where an employee is absent due to a **musculoskeletal or psychological condition**, you should meet with them at a **very early stage** to establish what forms of support can be offered.

**Timing:** Within the **first 2 weeks** of the absence starting

### Process

As this is a **formal attendance meeting**:

- ✏️ Employee should be invited to attend **in writing**
- 🤝 Advise them of their **right to be accompanied** by a colleague or trade union representative

### Criteria for Musculoskeletal Referral via OH

At the meeting, establish whether the employee meets the criteria:

- Which would **improve following treatment** and allow earlier return to work

### The Physiotherapy Report

You will receive a report from OH normally after:

- The **first session**
- The **last session**

The report will provide advice on:

- Impact of the employee's condition on their ability to perform their full range of duties
- Length of the course of treatment being provided
- Likely level of recovery
- Any reasonable adjustments or adaptations that could be made
- Employee's recovery (in the final report)

### When Physiotherapy Won't Be Provided

Physiotherapy support won't be provided in cases where the employee is **already receiving physiotherapy from another source**.

### Temporary Adjustments

You can get advice and guidance from OH on the range of duties the employee is fit to do. This information may help you make temporary adjustments to the employee's duties, which could help them return to work while still receiving treatment.

   - Occupational Health Service
   - Employee's doctor in the fit note

### Types of Supports and Reasonable Adjustments

You should try, where possible, to **accommodate any adjustments suggested**, bearing in mind your duty to make reasonable adjustments for employees who are classed as **disabled under the Equality Act**.

### Exploring All Options

---

## Redeployment

**In such cases:** Redeployment to an alternative role should be considered.

📖 **More information:** Redeployment Guidance and Information

---

---

## Return to Work Considerations

### When the Employee is Able to Return to Work

You should carry out a **return to work discussion** when the employee returns to work.

📋 **More information:** Manager's Return to Work Discussion Checklist

### Purpose of the Return to Work Meeting

The meeting provides you with the opportunity to:

- 👋 **Welcome the employee back** following their long-term absence
- ✅ **Check they're fit** to return to work
- 📰 **Update them** on any workplace developments
- 💬 **Discuss agreed actions** - How they'll work in practice (e.g., lighter duties, retraining programme)

### Regular Follow-Up Meetings

You should have **regular follow-up meetings** with the employee to review their progress, depending on the reason for the absence.

**Importance:** Provides an opportunity for the employee to express how they're finding being back at work.

**Particularly important** where the employee has been absent due to:

- Work-related stress
- Other psychological conditions

**Keep notes** of these meetings to help review their progress.

📖 **More information:** Supporting Attendance: Manager's Guide to Disability, Mental Health Problems and Stress

### Pay

You should confirm any **changes to the employee's pay**, if appropriate.

**Example:** Where the employee has returned to work on a part-time basis

---

## Reduction of Annual Leave

### Working Time Regulations 1998 (as amended)

All workers are entitled to a **statutory minimum of 5.6 weeks (28 days)** paid leave each year. This can include paid public holidays.

**This entitlement is pro-rated for part-time workers.**

### When Leave is Reduced

Where an employee is absent from work through sickness absence for a **single period of over 13 weeks** in a single leave year or spanning leave years, their entitlement to leave within the leave year should be **reduced proportionately**, providing that the employee receives the **statutory minimum annual leave entitlement** in each leave year.

**Need help calculating?** Contact your Strategic HR team

### Examples

**Example 1: Jim**

- **Absence:** 3rd January to 10th April (14 weeks)
- **Service:** 7 years
- **Complete months worked:** 8 (only absent January to April)
- **Entitlement:** 19.5 days + 11.5 public holidays = **31 days**
- **Result:** ✅ **Meets statutory minimum** (28 days)

**Example 2: Pam**

- **Absence:** 1st March to 2nd August
- **Complete months worked:** 5 months
- **Service:** 2 years
- **Initial calculation:** 11 days + 11.5 public holidays = 22.5 days
- **Result:** ❌ **Does not meet statutory minimum** (28 days)
- **Adjustment:** Adjusted to **28 days** to meet statutory minimum

### Term-Time Staff

For term-time staff, please refer to the appropriate **Management Circular**.

### Carry Forward of Untaken Statutory Leave

Where an employee is **unable to use their entitlement** to statutory leave due to sickness absence within the leave year, the employee should be allowed to **carry forward the untaken balance** of statutory leave into the next leave year.

**Important:** The carry forward only applies to the **untaken balance of statutory leave**, not the balance of untaken contractual leave provided for in the Council's conditions of service.

**Need advice?** Contact your Service Strategic HR team

## Disciplinary Considerations

Disciplinary action may be considered if there are **breaches of conduct** at any stage of the Supporting Attendance procedure (including the return to work process) in accordance with the Council's **Discipline and Appeals Procedure**, such as:

- ❌ Unauthorised absence
- ❌ Failure to comply with absence reporting procedures
- ❌ Abuse of the sick pay provisions
- ❌ Fraudulent conduct

---

## Capability and Ill Health Retiral Considerations

### When the Employee is Unable to Return to Work or Sustain an Acceptable Level of Attendance

You should **fully explore all options** in helping an employee to return to work or sustain an acceptable level of attendance, as outlined in earlier sections.

### Discussing Regularly

You should discuss this regularly with the employee during the course of their absence, confirming the details **in writing**.

### Advising of Potential Outcomes

You should also, where appropriate, advise the employee of the **potential outcome** in cases where they're unable to return to work and improve their attendance.

**In such cases:** You'll have to consider their continued employment with us.

### Making Every Effort

While you should **make every effort** to help and support an employee who is absent or unable to sustain an acceptable level of attendance, there are times when they remain **unfit for work**.

**If so:** You should first explore whether **ill health retiral** may be an option.

---

## Ill Health Retiral

### Ill Health Retiral (Excluding Teachers)

Ill health retiral is **only available** to employees who are members of **Strathclyde Pension Fund**.

### Referral to OH

You'll need to make a referral to OHS to determine whether the employee meets the criteria for ill health retiral.

OHS will also assess **how likely** it is that the employee will be capable of working at some point in the future.

### Two Tiers

| Tier | Criteria | Benefits |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | Employee is **unlikely to work again before age 65** | Higher pension benefits |
| **Tier 2** | Employee has a **reasonable prospect of working again before 65** | Standard pension benefits |

### Granting Ill Health Retiral

Approval must be sought from an **approved qualified medical practitioner** on whether the employee meets the eligibility criteria.

**Contact your Service Strategic HR team as soon as possible** for advice.

### Appeals

An employee can **appeal** against a decision not to grant ill health retiral.

If we can't resolve the complaint, the employee can use the **Internal Disputes Resolution Procedures (IDRP)**.

**More information:**

- Strathclyde Pension Fund
- Your Service Strategic HR team

### Teachers

If the employee is a teacher, an application should be made to the **Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA)**, together with supporting medical information.

**More information:**

- SPPA
- HR team within Education Services

## Capability Dismissal

### When to Consider Capability Dismissal

Where all reasonable options have been explored and the employee cannot return to work or maintain a satisfactory level of attendance, the employee should be progressed to a **lack of capability hearing**.

You may have to consider the option of **dismissal on capability grounds** where:

- ❌ The employee doesn't meet the criteria for ill health retiral
- ✅ You have explored all options of support
- ❌ The employee is still unable to return to work or sustain an acceptable level of attendance

### What is Capability Dismissal?

This means that an employee's contract of employment is terminated as they're **not fit to carry out their duties** or **attend work on a regular basis** due to ill health.

**Dismissal due to ill health is a potentially fair reason for dismissal.**

### Before Considering Capability Dismissal

Before considering capability dismissal, you will have:

✅ Sought advice and guidance from your **Service Strategic HR team**  
✅ Met with the employee **face-to-face on a regular basis**  
✅ Given the employee the **opportunity to put their side forward**  
✅ Issued letters **confirming the discussions** that have taken place  
✅ Sought up-to-date advice from **OHS**, where appropriate  
✅ Considered **reasonable offers of support** to aid a return to work  
✅ Explored options such as **phased return or lighter duties** that may enable a return to work  
✅ Explored whether the employee is **eligible for ill health retiral**  
✅ Advised the employee in writing of the **potential outcome of dismissal** should they be unable to improve attendance  

### Grounds for Dismissal

Capability dismissal may be appropriate in cases where:

- You can **no longer sustain the level of absence**
- You have **exhausted all other options** of support
- The employee is **unable to give an indication** of a return to work within the foreseeable future **OR** has been unable to sustain an acceptable level of attendance
- The employee **doesn't meet the criteria** for ill health retiral

### Terminal Illness

You may have to **suspend any decision to dismiss** in cases where an employee has been diagnosed as having a **terminal illness**.

**Important:** You need to consider such situations carefully and deal with them sensitively, taking the circumstances into account.

**Seek advice from:** Your Service Strategic HR team

### Inviting the Employee to the Meeting

You'll need to advise the employee **both verbally and in writing** when you have reached the point where you're considering terminating their contract on capability grounds.

**Your letter should:**

- ✅ Be clear that a **potential outcome may be dismissal**
- ✅ Advise the employee of their **right to be accompanied** by a colleague or trade union representative

**Template invite letter:** Your Strategic Service HR team can provide this

### Reaching a Decision

The Chair should consider **each case on its own merits** before reaching a decision.

**To help reach a decision, the following will be considered:**

- Length of the absence and whether a return to work in the foreseeable future is likely
- Reason for the absence
- Attendance history
- Effect of the disability or underlying health problem on their ability to carry out their current duties
- Effect of the absence on the service and/or section

**Advice and guidance should be sought from Strategic HR prior to a decision being made.**

### Confirming the Decision

You should confirm the employee's dismissal **in writing**, along with:

- 💰 Final pay arrangements
- ⚖️ Their right to **appeal** against the decision of dismissal
- 📋 Where appropriate, their right to appeal against the decision **not to grant ill health retiral** from the Strathclyde Pension Scheme

### Appeals Against Dismissal

If the employee considers their dismissal unfair, they may **appeal, in writing**, to the **Head of Human Resources** within **14 days** of receiving their letter confirming the decision.

**Appeal hearing:** The **Personnel Appeals Committee**, made up of a panel of Elected Members (Councillors), will hear the appeal.
