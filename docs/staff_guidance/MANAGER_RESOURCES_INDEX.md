## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Management

**Q: How often should I conduct return to work discussions?**  
A: After EVERY period of absence, regardless of length. Ideally on day of return or as soon as practicable.

**Q: Can I ask for medical evidence from day 1?**  
A: Self-certification applies for first 7 days. Fit note required from day 8. However, can request earlier if pattern of absence concerns.

**Q: What if an employee refuses an OH referral?**  
A: They can refuse, but explain it limits your ability to support them and make informed decisions about adjustments or capability.

### Equality Act & Disability

**Q: How do I know if Equality Act applies?**  
A: Substantial, long-term (12+ months) adverse effect on day-to-day activities. OH can advise. Seek Strategic HR guidance.

**Q: Do I have to make every adjustment an employee requests?**  
A: Only "reasonable" adjustments. Consider effectiveness, cost, practicality, impact on service. OH and HR can advise.

**Q: Can I dismiss someone with a disability for poor attendance?**  
A: Very complex - must exhaust all reasonable adjustments first. Always consult Strategic HR before any capability action involving disability.

### Procedures

**Q: What if I miss an attendance review trigger?**  
A: Arrange it as soon as identified. Don't delay further. Explain the delay to employee.

**Q: Can an employee bring someone to a return to work discussion?**  
A: It's informal so no automatic right, but good practice to allow if they request (unless abusing process).

**Q: How long can a phased return last?**  
A: Up to 4 weeks, fully paid. Can be recommended by OH, GP, or agreed between you and employee.

### Complex Cases

**Q: Employee has terminal diagnosis - what do I do?**  
A: Contact Strategic HR immediately. Dying to Work Charter applies - manage with dignity and compassion. Won't dismiss due to diagnosis unless in their best interests.

**Q: Pattern of Monday/Friday absences - can I challenge this?**  
A: Yes, if genuine concern. Discuss pattern at return to work/review. May indicate workplace issues or abuse. OH referral may help clarify.

**Q: Employee refuses to engage with support - what now?**  
A: Document lack of engagement. This becomes part of capability consideration. But continue offering support and explaining consequences.
