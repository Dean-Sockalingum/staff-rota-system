### Setting the Right Tone

**Remember:**

- 🤝 **Supportive**, not interrogatory
- 🤝 **Empathetic**, not judgmental
- 🤝 **Collaborative**, not confrontational
- 🤝 **Flexible**, not rigid

**Your goal:** Help them return to work successfully, not catch them out.

---

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Confirm the Condition

**Ask:**

- "Can you confirm the nature of your condition?"
- "Has anything changed since we last spoke?"
- "Have you received a diagnosis?"

**Why this matters:**

- Condition may change during absence (initial diagnosis incorrect, complications, new symptoms)
- Employee may have been keeping you updated, but good to confirm current status
- Accurate information needed for OH referrals and decision-making

**Example:**

*"When you first went off sick, you thought it was a back strain. Can you tell me what the doctors have said since then? Has there been a diagnosis?"*

---

### 2. Medication

**Ask:**

- "What medication have you been prescribed?"
- "Are there any side effects?"
- "How is the medication affecting you?"

**Why this matters:**

- **Safety critical** if employee operates machinery, drives, works with vulnerable people
- Some medications cause drowsiness, dizziness, impaired judgment
- Side effects may require adjustments when they return
- Indicates severity of condition and treatment plan

**Example:**

*"I need to ask about any medication you're taking. Are there any side effects I should be aware of, particularly when you return to work? For example, does it make you drowsy? This is important because you drive as part of your role."*

---

### 3. Further Tests and Appointments

**Ask:**

- "Are you waiting for any test results?"
- "Have you been referred to a consultant?"
- "Do you have any hospital appointments coming up?"
- "When will you know more about your condition?"

**Why this matters:**

- **Timing of OH referral** - better to wait until after tests/consultant appointment so OH has full medical picture
- **Prognosis clarity** - pending results may give clearer timescales
- **Planning** - can schedule next contact after key appointments

**Example:**

*"You mentioned you're waiting for an MRI scan. When is that scheduled? I think it would be helpful to wait until after that scan before I refer you to Occupational Health, so they have the most up-to-date information. Can we arrange to speak again once you've had your results?"*

---

### 4. Occupational Health Referral

**Discuss:**

- "I'm planning to refer you to Occupational Health for advice."
- "This will help me understand how best to support you."
- "They'll provide independent medical opinion on adjustments and return to work."

**Why this matters:**

- Employee may be anxious about OH referral (worried it's step towards dismissal)
- **Reassure:** OH's role is supportive, not punitive
- Explain what will happen and why it's helpful

**See:** [Manager's Guide: OH Referrals](./MANAGERS_OH_REFERRAL_GUIDE.md)

**Example:**

*"I'd like to refer you to Occupational Health for advice on how best to support you when you return to work. They're independent medical professionals who will assess your condition and suggest any adjustments that might help. This isn't about dismissal - it's about making sure I have expert advice to support you properly. They'll send you a questionnaire, then arrange an appointment. Is that okay with you?"*

---

### 5. Employee's Feelings About Their Condition

**Ask:**

- "How are you feeling about your condition?"
- "How are you coping?"
- "Is it affecting you emotionally as well as physically?"

**Why this matters:**

- **Emotional support** - illness can cause anxiety, depression, isolation
- **EAP referral** - may benefit from counseling
- **Understanding whole person** - not just medical facts

**Example:**

*"I know this has been a difficult time for you. How are you feeling about everything? Not just physically, but emotionally? It's normal to feel anxious or low when you're unwell. We have confidential counseling available through PAM Assist if you'd find it helpful to talk to someone - it's free and available 24/7 on 0800 247 1100."*

---

### 6. Employee's Feelings About Returning to Work

**Ask:**

- "How do you feel about returning to work?"
- "Are you worried about anything?"
- "What would make your return easier?"

**Why this matters:**

- **Anxiety is common** after long absence (lost confidence, worried about workload, fear of judgment)
- **Identify barriers** to return - address them proactively
- **Plan support** - phased return, reduced workload, buddy system

**Example:**

*"I understand you might feel anxious about coming back after being off for so long. That's completely normal. What are your main concerns? Is there anything we can do to make your return easier - like a phased return, or some time to catch up on what's happened while you've been away?"*

---

### 7. Expected Return to Work Date

**Ask:**

- "When do you think you'll be fit to return to work?"
- "What does your doctor say?"
- "What needs to happen before you can return?"

**Why this matters:**

- **Planning** - can prepare for return (cover arrangements, induction, adjustments)
- **Realistic expectations** - may change, but gives baseline
- **Employee engagement** - keeps return on agenda

**Example:**

*"I know it's hard to predict, but when do you think you might be fit to return? What does your GP say? Even if it changes, it helps me to plan. And we can discuss what needs to be in place before you come back."*

---

### 8. Adjustments for Return

**Discuss:**

- "Are there any adjustments that would help you return to work?"
- "Has your doctor recommended anything?"
- "What would make things easier for you?"

**Types of adjustments:**
- Phased return to work (gradual increase in hours)
- Reduced or adjusted duties (temporary or permanent)
- Equipment or workstation changes
- Flexible working hours
- Regular breaks
- Working from home

**See:** [Manager's Guide: Reasonable Adjustments](./MANAGERS_REASONABLE_ADJUSTMENTS_GUIDE.md)

**Example:**

*"Let's talk about what might help when you return. Your doctor mentioned you shouldn't lift heavy items for a while - we can arrange for other team members to cover those duties. Would a phased return help, so you build back up gradually? Maybe starting with 3 days a week, then 4, then full time?"*

---

### 9. Confirm Capability: Full or Restricted Duties

**Establish:**

- "Will you be able to return to your full range of duties?"
- "Or will you need restricted duties initially?"
- "For how long?"

**Sources of information:**
- GP fit note (may state "may be fit for work taking into account...")
- OH report recommendations
- Employee's own assessment
- Specialist consultant advice

**Agree timescales:**
- How long will restrictions last?
- When will you review?

**Example:**

*"Your fit note says you may be fit for work with adjusted duties - no heavy lifting and reduced hours. Let's agree specifically what that means. I suggest you return 4 hours a day for 2 weeks, then we review. And I'll make sure you're not allocated any manual handling tasks. We'll review this in a month. Does that sound reasonable?"*

---

### 10. Follow-Up Interview

**Agree:**

- "When should we speak again?"
- "What will trigger next contact?"

**Typical frequency:**
- Every **4-6 weeks** during long-term absence
- More often if:
  - Return imminent
  - Condition deteriorating
  - Management decisions needed

**Example:**

*"Let's schedule another catch-up in 4 weeks' time, after your consultant appointment. In the meantime, please keep in touch if anything changes. If you need anything or have any concerns, just call or email me. I'll also check in with you in about 2 weeks to see how you're doing."*

---

### 11. Sick Pay

**Discuss:**

- Current sick pay status (full pay, half pay, no pay)
- When pay will reduce (if applicable)
- Refer to policy for details

**Why this matters:**

- **Employee may not be aware** of when pay reduces
- **Financial worries** add to stress
- **Benefits advice** may be needed

**See:** [Sickness Absence: Leave and Pay](link)

**Example:**

*"I need to let you know where you are with sick pay. You've been off for 10 weeks, so you're currently on full pay. At 26 weeks, your pay will reduce to half pay. I wanted to make sure you're aware of that so you can plan. If you need advice on benefits you might be entitled to, PAM Assist can help with that, or you can contact your trade union."*

---

### 12. Management Decisions (If Appropriate)

**In some cases, you may need to discuss:**

- **Ill-health retirement** (if employee is pension fund member)
- **Termination on capability grounds** (last resort)

**⚠️ Only discuss if:**
- Long-term prognosis poor
- No prospect of return in foreseeable future
- All other options exhausted
- **HR advice obtained**

**See:** [Managers Attendance Guide](./MANAGERS_ATTENDANCE_GUIDE.md) for full guidance

**Example:**

*"I know this is difficult to hear, but based on what you and your doctors have said, it seems unlikely you'll be able to return to work in the near future. I want to discuss some options with you, including ill-health retirement. This is something the occupational health service would assess. I've asked HR to be involved in our next meeting so we can talk through this properly. This doesn't mean we're giving up on you - it's about making sure you have all the information about options available to you."*

**⚠️ Get HR advice before discussing termination options.**

---

✅ Welcome and thank them for meeting
✅ Explain purpose of meeting
✅ Set supportive tone

**Example opening:**

*"Thank you for meeting with me today. I want to have a proper catch-up about how you're doing and discuss how we can support you. This is not a disciplinary meeting - it's about making sure you're okay and planning your return to work when you're ready. How are you feeling?"*

---

**2. Discussion (30-40 minutes)**

✅ Work through key discussion points (above)

**Example closing:**

*"Thank you for being so open with me. Just to summarize: I'm going to refer you to Occupational Health this week and arrange for a fan at your desk for when you return. You're going to let me know after your consultant appointment next month. We'll speak again in 4 weeks to review progress. I'll send you a written summary of what we've discussed today. Is there anything else you need from me?"*

---

### What NOT to Say

**❌ AVOID:**

- "I know how you feel" (you don't)
- "It could be worse" (minimizes their experience)
- "When will you be back?" (pressures them)
- "We really need you back" (creates guilt)
- "Are you sure you're still sick?" (questions credibility)
- "Others manage to work with that condition" (compares unfairly)
- "You're letting the team down" (blames them)

**✅ INSTEAD SAY:**

- "That sounds really difficult"
- "I'm here to support you"
- "What would help you?"
- "Take the time you need to recover"

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Employee Reluctant to Discuss Condition

**Situation:**
Employee has been off for 6 weeks with "stress." In absence interview, they're reluctant to discuss details. They say "I don't want to talk about it" and seem defensive.

**Your response:**

1. ✅ **Reassure**
   - "I'm not trying to pry into personal details. I just want to make sure you have the support you need."

2. ✅ **Explain why you're asking**
   - "I need to understand enough to make any adjustments that might help when you return, and to know if an OH referral would be helpful."

3. ✅ **Respect boundaries**
   - "You don't have to share medical details, but it would help if you could tell me generally what might help you at work."

4. ✅ **Offer alternatives**
   - "If you're more comfortable, I can refer you to OH and they can provide me with advice without sharing your diagnosis with me."
   - "Would you prefer to bring a trade union rep to our next meeting?"

5. ✅ **Focus on return**
   - "What we really need to discuss is what would help you return to work. Can we talk about that?"

**Example outcome:**  
*"I understand you don't want to go into details about your medical condition, and that's okay. What I do need to know is whether there are any adjustments that would help when you return to work. I'm going to refer you to Occupational Health - they'll discuss your condition with you confidentially and give me advice on how to support you, without sharing your diagnosis. How does that sound?"*

---

### Scenario 2: Employee Says They'll "Never" Return

**Situation:**
Employee off long-term with chronic condition. In interview, they say "I don't think I'll ever be able to come back to this job."

**Your response:**

1. ✅ **Listen and acknowledge**
   - "I hear that you're feeling that way. Can you tell me more about why you think that?"

2. ✅ **Explore options**
   - "Is it the specific duties that are the problem, or something else?"
   - "Have you thought about what might make it possible?"

3. ✅ **Discuss adjustments and alternatives**
   - Adjusted duties
   - Different role (redeployment)
   - Reduced hours
   - Home working

4. ✅ **Refer to OH**
   - "Let's get expert medical advice on whether there are adjustments that could enable you to return."

5. ✅ **Discuss ill-health retirement** (if applicable)
   - If employee is pension fund member
   - Requires OH assessment

6. ✅ **Involve HR**
   - Complex decisions
   - Capability process

**Example outcome:**  
*"I understand you feel you can't return to your current role. Let's explore options. Are there specific duties that are the problem? OH can advise whether adjustments could help. If you're a pension fund member, we can also explore ill-health retirement. I'm going to involve HR so we can discuss all your options properly. This doesn't mean we're giving up - it means we're making sure you have all the information to make the best decision for you."*

---

### Scenario 3: Employee Avoiding Contact

**Situation:**
Employee has been off for 8 weeks. You've called and emailed multiple times to arrange absence interview, but they don't respond. Fit notes are being emailed but no other contact.

**Your response:**

1. ✅ **Send letter** (not just email)
   - May not be checking work email
   - Letter to home address

2. ✅ **Be clear and supportive in tone**
   - "I'm concerned about you and want to check you're okay."
   - "I need to arrange a meeting to discuss how we can support you."

3. ✅ **Give deadline**
   - "Please contact me by [date] to arrange a meeting."

4. ✅ **Explain consequences**
   - "If I don't hear from you, I may need to make decisions without your input, which I'd prefer not to do."

5. ✅ **Offer options**
   - Phone call instead of meeting
   - Bring TU rep
   - Contact via representative

6. ✅ **If still no response:**
   - Seek HR advice
   - May constitute breach of contact requirements
   - Formal letter warning of potential action

**Example letter:**

*Dear [Name],*

*I've tried to contact you several times by phone and email to arrange a meeting to discuss your absence and how we can support you. I'm concerned that I haven't heard back from you.*

*I need to meet with you to:*
*- Check how you're doing*
*- Discuss your condition and progress*
*- Explore any support or adjustments you might need*
*- Plan for your return to work*

*Please contact me by 28th February to arrange a meeting. We can meet at your home, at work, or have a phone conversation - whichever is most comfortable for you. You're welcome to bring a trade union representative.*

*If I don't hear from you by this date, I may need to make decisions about your absence without your input, which I would prefer not to do.*

*I hope you're recovering well and look forward to hearing from you.*

*Best wishes,*  
*[Your name]*

### Scenario 4: Employee Wants to Return Before Fit Note Expires

**Situation:**
Employee's fit note says off until end of month, but in absence interview they say they feel ready to return next week.

**Your response:**

1. ✅ **Check they understand**
   - "Your fit note says you're off until the end of the month. Has something changed?"

2. ✅ **Encourage GP discussion**
   - "Have you spoken to your GP about returning early?"
   - "I'd recommend checking with them first."

3. ✅ **Assess readiness**
   - "What makes you feel ready to return?"
   - "Are you sure you're not rushing?"

4. ✅ **Plan phased return**
   - "Would a phased return be sensible, rather than jumping straight back to full duties?"

5. ✅ **Require updated fit note**
   - "If your GP agrees you're fit to return, please get an updated fit note saying you're fit for work."

6. ✅ **Prepare for return**
   - Arrange adjustments
   - Update team
   - Schedule return to work interview

**Example outcome:**  
*"I'm glad you're feeling better! However, your current fit note says you're off until the end of the month. Please speak to your GP about returning early - if they agree, they can issue a new fit note saying you're fit for work. In the meantime, let's discuss a phased return so you build back up gradually rather than going straight to full-time. How about starting with 3 days a week?"*

---

### Scenario 5: Employee Discloses Serious Diagnosis

**Situation:**
In absence interview, employee tells you they've been diagnosed with cancer. They're upset and uncertain about the future.

**Your response:**

1. ✅ **Show compassion**
   - "I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be incredibly difficult for you and your family."

2. ✅ **Give them time**
   - Don't rush the conversation
   - Let them talk

3. ✅ **Focus on support**
   - "We'll support you through this. Please don't worry about work right now."
   - "What do you need from us?"

4. ✅ **Discuss practical matters sensitively**
   - Treatment plan and timescales
   - When they might know more
   - Sick pay (reassure them)

5. ✅ **Signpost to support**
   - PAM Assist (EAP) - counseling
   - Macmillan Benefits Service (if Council employee) - 0141 420 8123
   - Trade union support

6. ✅ **Agree flexible contact**
   - "Let's agree that you'll contact me when you feel able. I won't pressure you for updates."

7. ✅ **Reassure about job**
   - "Your job is secure. Focus on your treatment and recovery."

**Example outcome:**  
*"I'm so sorry you're going through this. Please know that we'll support you in any way we can. Don't worry about work right now - focus on your treatment and getting the support you need. I've noted that you'll be starting chemotherapy next month, so I'll plan on that basis. I'd suggest calling Macmillan Benefits Service (0141 420 8123) who can advise on financial support. PAM Assist also offers free counseling if that would help. Let's agree that you'll contact me when you feel able - I won't chase you for updates. Please take care of yourself and your family."*
