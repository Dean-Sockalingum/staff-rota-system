# Manager's Attendance Review Meeting Checklist

## Introduction

This checklist sets out what you'll need to do both **before** and **during** a formal attendance review meeting.

**When to use this checklist:**
- The employee's absence record has **breached Council trigger points**
- You need to conduct a formal meeting to discuss attendance concerns
- You're planning management action due to unsustainable attendance levels

**This is a formal process.** The employee has the **right to be accompanied** by a colleague or trade union representative.

> **💡 Important:** An attendance review meeting is different from a return to work discussion. This is a formal meeting triggered by attendance thresholds being met or exceeded.

---

### Outcome 4: Consider Reasonable Adjustments

**When:**
- Disability or long-term health condition
- OH report recommends adjustments
- Adjustments could support improvement

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Short-Term Frequent Absences (Trigger Met)

**Situation:**
Employee has had 5 separate short absences in 6 months (trigger is 4). All for different minor illnesses (cold, migraine, stomach upset, etc.). No pattern. All properly reported.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Can you explain the reason for each of these absences?"
- "Is there an underlying health condition we should be aware of?"
- "Have you seen your GP about these recurring issues?"
- "Are you aware of the EAP service?"
- "Is there anything at work that might be affecting your health?"

**Likely Actions:**
- ✅ Continue monitoring for 6 months
- ✅ Offer EAP referral
- ✅ Consider OH referral if pattern continues
- ✅ Set review date
- ✅ Explain expectations (no further breaches)
- ✅ Confirm consequences (formal warning if continues)

**Example Outcome:** *"I'm going to continue monitoring your attendance for 6 months. I'd like you to contact the EAP to discuss support for your general wellbeing. I expect to see no further trigger point breaches. We'll review again in 6 months. If there's no improvement, I'll need to consider formal action."*

---

### Scenario 2: Long-Term Absence Followed by Return

**Situation:**
Employee had 8-week absence for surgery, returned to work, then has since had 3 separate short absences in 4 months (back pain related to surgery recovery). Total days lost breaches trigger.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "How are you recovering from your surgery?"
- "Are these recent absences related to your surgery?"
- "Did you have a phased return? Is it working?"
- "Have you discussed ongoing pain with your GP?"
- "Would an OH referral be helpful to explore adjustments?"
- "Do you need any adjustments to your duties or workstation?"

**Likely Actions:**
- ✅ **OH referral** (explore ongoing medical issues and adjustments)
- ✅ Adjourn meeting to await OH report
- ✅ Consider adjustments based on OH recommendations
- ✅ Monitor attendance during recovery period
- ✅ Set review date after adjustments in place

**Example Outcome:** *"I'm going to refer you to Occupational Health to get expert advice on your recovery and what adjustments might help. I'm adjourning this meeting until we receive their report. Once we have that, we'll reconvene to discuss what support we can offer."*

---

### Scenario 3: Stress/Mental Health Related Absence

**Situation:**
Employee has had multiple absences totaling 15 days over 6 months, all stress/anxiety related. OH report suggests work-related stress. Employee has engaged with EAP.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Can you tell me more about what's causing your stress?"
- "Is there anything about your work or workplace that's contributing?"
- "Have you found the EAP helpful?"
- "What would help you manage stress better at work?"
- "Have we completed a stress risk assessment?"
- "Would Able Futures (CBT) be helpful?"

**Likely Actions:**
- ✅ **Stress risk assessment** (if not done)
- ✅ Explore workplace issues (workload, relationships, role)
- ✅ **Able Futures referral** (free CBT for work-related stress)
- ✅ Consider adjustments (flexible working, reduced caseload, etc.)
- ✅ Regular wellbeing check-ins
- ✅ Monitor with reasonable expectation (given mental health)
- ✅ Set review date (3-6 months)

**Example Outcome:** *"I'm going to arrange a stress risk assessment to identify what's causing stress at work. I'm also referring you to Able Futures for cognitive behavioral therapy support. Let's discuss some immediate adjustments to your workload. I'll monitor your attendance over the next 6 months with understanding that you're receiving treatment."*

**⚠️ Important:** Mental health is a protected characteristic. Be sensitive and supportive.

---

### Scenario 4: Pattern of Absences (Mondays/Fridays)

**Situation:**
Employee has 6 absences over 6 months (breaches trigger). 5 out of 6 are on Mondays or Fridays. No medical certificates. All self-certified for minor ailments.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "I've noticed that most of your absences fall on Mondays and Fridays. Can you explain this pattern?"
- "Is there a reason why you tend to be unwell at the start/end of the week?"
- "Is there something about your work schedule that's difficult?"
- "Are there any issues at work that we need to discuss?"
- "Are you finding it difficult to balance work and personal commitments?"

**Likely Actions:**
- ✅ **Address pattern directly** (this may suggest misconduct)
- ✅ Explore if genuine reasons or poor attendance culture
- ✅ **Formal warning** if no acceptable explanation
- ✅ Close monitoring (may require medical certificates for all future absences)
- ✅ Consider disciplinary if pattern continues and no medical evidence
- ✅ Set very clear expectations

**Example Outcome:** *"I'm concerned about the pattern of your absences falling on Mondays and Fridays. I need to see immediate improvement in your attendance. I'm issuing a formal warning. Going forward, I may require medical certificates for all absences, not just those over 7 days. If this pattern continues, I'll consider disciplinary action."*

**⚠️ Be careful:** Don't assume dishonesty, but address concerning patterns clearly.

---

### Scenario 5: Disability-Related Absence

**Situation:**
Employee has diabetes (disclosed disability). Has had 8 absences in 12 months related to diabetes management and complications (hospital appointments, hypos, etc.). Total 20 days lost.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "How are you managing your diabetes?"
- "Are your hospital appointments routine or urgent?"
- "Can any appointments be scheduled outside working hours?"
- "What adjustments would help you manage your condition at work?"
- "Has OH advised on adjustments?"
- "Are there any triggers at work that affect your diabetes?"

**Likely Actions:**
- ✅ **Equality Act 2010 applies** - disability-related absence
- ✅ **Do not include disability-related absence** in trigger point calculation (if clearly related)
- ✅ OH referral to confirm reasonable adjustments
- ✅ Implement adjustments (time off for appointments, breaks to manage blood sugar, etc.)
- ✅ **Disability leave** (if council policy allows for appointments)
- ✅ Monitor non-disability absence separately
- ✅ Regular wellbeing check-ins

**Example Outcome:** *"I understand your absences are related to your diabetes. Under the Equality Act, we need to make reasonable adjustments to support you. I'm going to refer you to OH to confirm what adjustments would help. I'm not including your diabetes-related absences in the trigger point calculation, but I do need to monitor your overall health and capability to do your role."*

**⚠️ Critical:** Seek HR advice. Disability-related absence requires different approach.

---

### Scenario 6: No Engagement from Employee

**Situation:**
Employee has repeatedly breached triggers. Has not attended return to work discussions, refused OH referral, not engaged with EAP. No improvement despite previous attendance review.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Why have you not attended return to work discussions?"
- "Why did you refuse the OH referral I offered?"
- "Do you understand the seriousness of your attendance record?"
- "Is there a reason you're not engaging with the support we've offered?"
- "What do you think needs to happen now?"

**Likely Actions:**
- ✅ **Formal written warning** (or final warning if repeat)
- ✅ Make it clear: non-engagement is unacceptable
- ✅ **Mandatory OH referral** (explain it's part of their contract)
- ✅ Very close monitoring (short review period - 3 months)
- ✅ **Capability procedure** if no engagement or improvement
- ✅ Consider disciplinary if failure to engage is willful

**Example Outcome:** *"You've repeatedly failed to engage with the support offered and have not attended return to work discussions. This is unacceptable. I'm issuing you with a formal written warning. I'm also referring you to Occupational Health - this is not optional. If you fail to attend the OH appointment or if there's no immediate improvement in your attendance, I'll be moving to capability procedures which could result in dismissal."*

**⚠️ Important:** Non-engagement is a serious issue. Document thoroughly.
