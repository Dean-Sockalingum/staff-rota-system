## Feature #1: Intelligent Overtime Distribution

### What It Does

Automatically ranks staff for overtime coverage based on:
- **Availability** (40%): Are they already working? On leave?
- **Acceptance Rate** (25%): How often do they say yes?
- **Fairness** (20%): Who hasn't had OT recently?
- **Proximity** (10%): Who lives closest to the home?
- **Reliability** (5%): Past attendance record

### When to Use It

✅ **Use Intelligent OT when:**
- You have an uncovered shift
- Someone calls in sick
- You need to backfill quickly
- You want to ensure fair OT distribution

❌ **Don't use it when:**
- You need a specific person (just call them directly)
- It's an emergency (use phone first, then log it)
- The shift is more than 2 weeks away

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Access Overtime Management

**Traditional Method (20 minutes):**
1. Check who worked recently → manual spreadsheet
2. Call 5 people, get 3 voicemails
3. Send texts to others
4. Wait for responses
5. Manually track who said yes/no

**With Intelligent OT (3 minutes):**
1. Click **"Request OT Coverage"** on the shift
2. System shows ranked candidates: Mary (95%), John (88%), Sarah (76%)
3. Click **"Contact Top 3"**
4. Mary accepts via SMS in 5 minutes
5. Assign shift, done!

**Time saved:** 17 minutes per incident × 8 incidents/week = **2.3 hours/week**

## Feature #3: Smart Shift Swap Auto-Approval

### What It Does

Automatically approves shift swap requests when they meet 5 safety checks:
1. ✅ Both staff qualified for roles
2. ✅ No overtime created
3. ✅ Working Time Directive compliance maintained
4. ✅ Skill mix requirements met
5. ✅ No excessive consecutive shifts

**Expected auto-approval rate:** 60%

### When to Use It

This feature works automatically in the background. Staff submit swap requests, and:
- ✅ **Auto-approved** if all checks pass
- ⏸️ **Requires manager review** if any check fails

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Staff Submit Swap Request
Staff use the mobile app or web:
1. Find shift they want to swap
2. Select colleague to swap with
3. Submit request

#### Step 2: Automatic Processing
System checks 5 rules:

```
Checking swap request: Sarah ↔ John (Mon Early shift)

✓ Qualification check: Both RGN qualified ✅
✓ Hours check: No overtime created ✅
✓ WTD check: Rest periods maintained ✅
✓ Skill mix check: Senior coverage OK ✅
✓ Consecutive shifts: Within limits ✅

Result: AUTO-APPROVED ✓
```

#### Step 3: Notification
- **If auto-approved:**
  - Both staff notified immediately
  - Swap appears on rota
  - No manager action needed
  
- **If requires review:**
  - You receive notification
  - View in **Management → Shift Swaps**
  - See which check failed
  - Approve or deny manually

#### Step 4: Review Declined Swaps (Optional)
1. Go to **Management → Shift Swaps → History**
2. Filter: Auto-declined
3. See reason for each decline
4. Contact staff if needed to explain

### Understanding Auto-Approval Rules

#### Rule 1: Qualification Check
**Passes if:** Both staff have required certifications for the role

**Fails if:**
- Sarah is RGN but John is HCA → Can't swap RGN shift
- Role requires Manual Handling cert that one person lacks

**Your action:** Deny swap, explain to staff

---

#### Rule 2: Hours Check
**Passes if:** Swap doesn't create overtime for either person

**Fails if:**
- Swap would put someone over 37.5 hours/week
- One person already at max contracted hours

**Your action:** Deny or approve with OT payment

---

#### Rule 3: Working Time Directive
**Passes if:** Both staff maintain required rest periods

**Fails if:**
- Swap creates less than 11 hours between shifts
- Would exceed 48 hours in 7-day period

**Your action:** Deny (compliance issue)

---

#### Rule 4: Skill Mix
**Passes if:** Unit still has required senior staff coverage

**Fails if:**
- Swapping the only senior nurse on shift
- Would leave unit without qualified supervisor

**Your action:** Deny or find alternative coverage

---

#### Rule 5: Consecutive Shifts
**Passes if:** No one works more than 7 consecutive shifts

**Fails if:**
- Swap creates 8+ consecutive working days
- Violates rest day requirements

**Your action:** Deny (safety/wellbeing issue)

### Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Trust the auto-approval system (it's accurate)
- Review declined swaps weekly to spot patterns
- Communicate rules clearly to staff
- Celebrate high auto-approval rate (less work for you!)

❌ **Don't:**
- Override auto-approvals without good reason
- Ignore compliance violations flagged by system
- Approve swaps that fail skill mix checks

### Example Scenario

**Traditional Method:**
- Staff email/text you about swap
- You check: Are they qualified? Will it create OT? Do we need skill mix?
- You check paper rota for consecutive shifts
- You check WTD compliance manually
- You respond to both staff
- **Time:** 10-15 minutes per swap request

**With Auto-Approval:**
- Staff submit swap in app
- System checks 5 rules in 2 seconds
- Auto-approves if safe
- Staff notified immediately
- You only review the 40% that need manual review
- **Time:** 0 minutes (for 60% of swaps), 5 minutes (for 40%)

**Time saved:** 10 minutes × 8 swaps/week × 60% auto-approval = **48 minutes/week**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: Do I need to use all 4 features?**  
A: No, but they work best together. Start with Intelligent OT and Proactive Suggestions, then add others.

**Q: Will AI make decisions without my approval?**  
A: Only Shift Swap Auto-Approval makes automatic decisions, and only for low-risk swaps. Everything else is suggestions that you control.

**Q: What if the AI is wrong?**  
A: You always have final say. If you disagree with a suggestion, you can ignore it. The system learns from your decisions over time.

---

### Intelligent OT

**Q: What if the top-ranked person isn't available after all?**  
A: Contact the next person on the list. Rankings are based on preferences and past behavior, but circumstances change.

**Q: Can I override the ranking?**  
A: Yes! Rankings are suggestions. You can contact anyone you want. The system just helps you make fair, data-driven decisions.

**Q: What if staff don't update their preferences?**  
A: The system still works using past acceptance rates and availability. Encourage staff to keep preferences current for best results.

---

### Proactive Suggestions

**Q: How often are suggestions updated?**  
A: Every 5 minutes. The dashboard auto-refreshes to show the latest issues.

**Q: What if I disagree with a suggestion?**  
A: Ignore it. Suggestions are based on data patterns, but you know your team best. Use them as a guide, not gospel.

**Q: Can I turn off certain categories?**  
A: Not yet, but you can filter them out. We're planning category preferences in future updates.

---

### Shift Swap Auto-Approval

**Q: What if the system auto-approves a swap I don't like?**  
A: You can reverse it manually. Review the auto-approval history weekly and adjust if needed.

**Q: Why was this swap declined?**  
A: Check the swap history - it shows which of the 5 checks failed. Common reasons: qualification mismatch, WTD violation.

**Q: Can I adjust the auto-approval rules?**  
A: Not currently. Rules are based on regulatory requirements and safety. Contact IT if you think a rule needs adjusting.

---

### Rota Health Scoring

**Q: What's a good target score?**  
A: Aim for 80+ (B grade). Scores of 90+ are excellent. Below 70 needs attention.

**Q: Why is my score lower than I expected?**  
A: Check component scores - one low component can drag down overall. Focus on the lowest-scoring areas first.

**Q: Can I compare my score with other managers?**  
A: Not directly (different homes have different challenges). Focus on your own trends - aim to improve week over week.
