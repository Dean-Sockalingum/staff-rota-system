## SAtSD Principles Applied to User Research

### **Principle 1: Focus on people and their experiences**
**Application:**
- Quality managers are primary users of TQM modules (not just system administrators)
- Research explores their day-to-day workflows, frustrations, and workarounds
- Understanding emotional journey: stress during inspections, satisfaction from closed-loop QI

**Research Questions:**
- What does a typical day look like for a quality manager in a care home?
- What tasks are most time-consuming? Most stressful? Most rewarding?
- How do you currently prepare for Care Inspectorate inspections?

---

### **Principle 2: Be inclusive throughout**
**Application:**
- Recruit diverse participants: new quality managers (<1 year) + experienced (3+ years)
- Include managers from different home sizes (small 20-bed vs. large 60-bed)
- Consider managers with varying IT literacy (digital natives vs. paper-first)

**Recruitment Strategy:**
- Target 3-5 participants across current 5 care homes
- Ensure representation: 1 new manager, 2 mid-experience, 1 senior
- Diversity in inspection history: recent inspections (last 6 months) + upcoming inspections

---

### **Principle 3: Collaborate and co-design**
**Application:**
- Participatory design workshops where managers sketch workflows and interfaces
- Iterative prototyping: show mockups → gather feedback → refine → repeat
- Managers become co-creators, not just interviewees

**Co-Design Activities:**
- Workflow mapping sessions (current state vs. ideal future state)
- Paper prototyping of TQM module screens
- Feature prioritization exercises (MoSCoW method: Must/Should/Could/Won't)

---

### **Principle 4: Build on what works, and challenge what doesn't**
**Application:**
- Identify strengths in current quality systems (manual processes that work well)
- Challenge inefficiencies (duplicate data entry, lost documentation, reactive incident response)
- Leverage existing staff rota system foundations (audit trail, role-based access)

**Research Questions:**
- What aspects of your current quality management system work well?
- What frustrates you most about current processes?
- If you could wave a magic wand, what would you change?

---

### **Principle 5: Start with the whole picture, then focus on specifics**
**Application:**
- Begin research understanding overall quality management ecosystem (not just one module)
- Map interdependencies: How do audits inform training needs? How do incidents trigger policy updates?
- Then drill down into specific TQM module workflows

**Research Sequence:**
1. **Session 1:** Big picture quality management (60 min)
2. **Session 2:** Deep dive on top 2 priority modules (90 min)
3. **Session 3:** Co-design workshop on specific features (3 hrs)

---

### **Principle 6: Work iteratively, with feedback loops**
**Application:**
- User research → Design → Prototype → Test → Refine (repeat)
- Show early wireframes to participants for feedback before coding
- Beta testing with same quality managers post-development

**Feedback Loops:**
- Week 1: Interviews + initial findings synthesis
- Week 2: Wireframe review sessions (30 min each participant)
- Week 3: Revised prototypes + feature prioritization
- Week 4: Final specifications review + user acceptance criteria

---

### **Principle 7: Be evidence-led and data-informed**
**Application:**
- Quantify current pain points (hours spent on quality tasks, inspection prep time)
- Use system usage data to inform priorities (which reports are most accessed?)
- Evidence-based decision making on feature scope (ROI analysis)

**Data Collection:**
- Time-motion study: How long do current quality tasks take?
- Error rate analysis: How often are mistakes made in manual quality processes?
- Compliance metrics: What % of quality indicators currently have evidence?

## Workflow Shadowing Observation Guide

### **Preparation**

**Pre-Visit:**
- Schedule 2-4 hour block when quality manager has typical tasks (not meetings)
- Bring: Notebook, camera (for screenshots/whiteboards), recording device (if consented)
- Review interview notes from this participant to know what to watch for

**Introduction:**
"Thank you for letting me shadow you today. I'm here to observe your natural workflow - please just go about your normal tasks and I'll quietly take notes. Feel free to think aloud if you're comfortable, explaining what you're doing and why. If anything is confidential, just let me know and I won't record it. Sound good?"

---

### **Observation Focus Areas**

**1. Physical Environment:**
- Where does quality manager work? (Office? Shared space? On the move?)
- What tools are within arm's reach? (Computer, binders, forms, phone?)
- Are quality documents easily accessible or tucked away?
- Is the workspace organized or chaotic? (Not judging - understanding context)

**2. Technology Usage:**
- What systems/software are used? (Excel, Word, email, third-party tools?)
- How often does quality manager switch between systems?
- Any manual data entry or duplicate entry?
- Any system frustrations observed? (Slow loading, crashes, confusing interfaces?)

**3. Communication Patterns:**
- Who does quality manager interact with? (Staff, managers, residents, families, external agencies?)
- Mode of communication? (Face-to-face, phone, email, WhatsApp?)
- How are quality issues escalated or reported?
- Any communication breakdowns observed?

**4. Task Workflows:**
- **If conducting an audit:** Watch the entire process
  - How is checklist accessed? (Print from computer? Pre-printed binder? Digital tablet?)
  - How are findings recorded? (Paper → later transcribed? Direct entry?)
  - How long does audit take?
  - What happens immediately after audit? (Email report? File in cabinet?)
- **If investigating an incident:** Observe documentation process
  - Forms used? (Paper vs. digital?)
  - Who is interviewed? (How long does gathering info take?)
  - Where is incident logged?
  - Follow-up actions assigned how?
- **If preparing for meeting/inspection:** Watch evidence gathering
  - Where is evidence located? (Multiple folders? Different systems?)
  - How long to find specific data point?
  - Any evidence gaps or "I know I have that somewhere..."?

**5. Workarounds & Hacks:**
- Watch for unofficial processes (sticky notes, personal trackers)
- Listen for phrases like "I usually just..." or "The system doesn't do X, so I..."
- Note any manual processes that could be automated
- Identify double-entry (same data entered multiple places)

**6. Emotional Cues:**
- When does quality manager seem stressed? (Specific tasks?)
- When does quality manager seem satisfied/proud? (Completed task? Good finding?)
- Any visible frustration with current processes?

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Low Participant Recruitment**
- **Mitigation:** Offer flexibility in participation (virtual interviews if on-site difficult)
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize personal benefit (features designed for their needs)
- **Mitigation:** HOS endorsement email emphasizing importance

**Risk 2: Workshop Scheduling Conflicts**
- **Mitigation:** Send save-the-date 2 weeks in advance
- **Mitigation:** Offer alternative workshop date if 50%+ cannot attend primary date
- **Mitigation:** Hybrid workshop (in-person + video call for remote participants)

**Risk 3: Participant Fatigue (Too Much Involvement)**
- **Mitigation:** Clear time commitments upfront (total 7-10 hours over 4 weeks)
- **Mitigation:** Respect participant time (start/end on schedule)
- **Mitigation:** Show appreciation (thank you notes, recognition in documentation)

**Risk 4: Divergent Feature Priorities**
- **Mitigation:** Data-driven prioritization (MoSCoW voting, not just loudest voice)
- **Mitigation:** Focus on MVP consensus (can't please everyone in first release)
- **Mitigation:** Document all requests, commit to revisiting in future releases

**Risk 5: Unrealistic Feature Expectations**
- **Mitigation:** Technical feasibility assessment in parallel with co-design
- **Mitigation:** Transparent communication about constraints (time, budget, complexity)
- **Mitigation:** Frame as iterative (MVP now, enhancements later)
