# 📊 Annual Leave Usage Targets - Management Guide

## Overview

This guide helps managers monitor staff annual leave usage to prevent year-end build-up and ensure staff take adequate rest throughout the year.

---

## 🎯 The 40-Week Target Strategy

### **Core Principle**

Staff should use their annual leave **evenly over 40 working weeks** to:
- ✅ Prevent year-end leave rush
- ✅ Ensure adequate rest throughout the year
- ✅ Maintain service coverage
- ✅ Avoid leave being lost or carried over excessively

### **Why 40 Weeks?**

- Accounts for **52 weeks** in a year
- Minus **~8 weeks** for bank holidays, unit closures, training days
- Minus **~4 weeks** buffer for flexibility
- = **40 active working weeks** for planned leave usage

---

## 📋 Leave Usage Targets by Entitlement

### **Standard Targets (40-week period)**

| Entitlement Level | Total Days | **Days/Week** | **Days/Month** | Hours/Week |
|-------------------|------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **Full-time (39.67 days)** | 297.5 hrs | **~1.0 day** | **~4.3 days** | 7.44 hrs |
| **Part-time (35 days)** | 262.5 hrs | **~0.9 day** | **~3.8 days** | 6.56 hrs |
| **Reduced (30 days)** | 225.0 hrs | **~0.8 day** | **~3.3 days** | 5.62 hrs |
| **Enhanced (45 days)** | 337.5 hrs | **~1.1 days** | **~4.9 days** | 8.44 hrs |

### **Simplified Rule of Thumb**

> **Target: Staff should take approximately 1 day off per week over 40 weeks**
> 
> Or: **4-5 days per month consistently throughout the year**

## 📈 Monitoring Leave Usage - Traffic Light System

### **Green Status** ✅ (On Target)
- Staff member is **within ±10%** of expected usage
- Taking leave regularly throughout the year
- No action required

**Example:** By end of June (26 weeks), staff with 40-day entitlement should have used:
- Expected: ~20 days (50% of entitlement)
- Green range: 18-22 days used

### **Amber Status** ⚠️ (Slightly Behind)
- Staff member is **10-25% behind** expected usage
- May need gentle reminder
- Monitor next month

**Example:** By end of June:
- Expected: ~20 days
- Amber range: 15-18 days used
- **Action:** Informal discussion about leave plans

### **Red Status** 🔴 (Significantly Behind)
- Staff member is **more than 25% behind** expected usage
- Requires intervention
- Risk of year-end problems

**Example:** By end of June:
- Expected: ~20 days
- Red: Less than 15 days used
- **Action:** Formal discussion, mandatory leave booking

## 📝 Manager Conversation Templates

### **Green Status - No Issues**
```
"Hi [Name], just checking in on leave. I can see you're taking regular 
breaks throughout the year which is great. Keep it up!"
```

### **Amber Status - Gentle Reminder**
```
"Hi [Name], I've noticed you're a bit behind on using your annual leave.
You have [X] days remaining and we're [Y] months through the year.

Have you got any leave planned for the next few months? It's important 
you take regular breaks. Let me know if you need help planning coverage."
```

### **Red Status - Intervention Required**
```
"Hi [Name], I need to discuss your annual leave with you. You currently 
have [X] days remaining with only [Y] months left in the year.

This is significantly behind where we'd expect you to be. I need you to:
1. Book at least [Z] days of leave in the next month
2. Provide me with a plan for using the rest before December

Taking regular leave is important for your wellbeing and is a requirement.
Let's meet to discuss what's preventing you from taking leave."
```

   - `total_entitlement_hours` - Total for the year
   - `hours_used` - Already taken
   - `hours_remaining` - Still to use
   - `hours_pending` - Booked but not yet approved/taken

- Remaining hours and days
- Urgency level (🔴🟡🟢)
- Quick action links

### **Using Reports Dashboard**

1. **Go to:** Reports → Annual Leave Report

## 📊 Team-Level Monitoring

### **Unit-Wide Targets**

Managers should ensure their **entire team** is on target collectively:

- Calculate total team entitlement
- Check total team usage
- Target: Team should use ~1 day per staff member per week

### **Example: Team of 10 Full-time Staff**

| Metric | Calculation | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Total Entitlement | 10 × 39.67 days | 396.7 days |
| Weekly Target | 396.7 ÷ 40 weeks | 9.9 days/week |
| Monthly Target | 9.9 × 4.33 weeks | 42.9 days/month |

**By end of June (26 weeks):**
- Expected team usage: 257 days (65%)
- Green range: 231-283 days
- Amber range: 193-231 days
- Red: <193 days
