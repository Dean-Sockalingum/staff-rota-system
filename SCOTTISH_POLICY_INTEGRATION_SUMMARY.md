## Key Quotes from Scottish Digital Strategy

### Vision Statement
> "Smarter, faster and fairer public services redesigned around people rather than 
> organizational boundaries"

**Staff Rota System Demonstration:**
Multi-home architecture enables 821 staff across 5 care homes to access unified platform. Staff can request leave from any location. Senior dashboard provides cross-home strategic insights impossible with siloed systems.

### Emerging Technologies
> "Practical applications of emerging technologies to enable more efficient and financially 
> sustainable services"

**Staff Rota System Demonstration:**
Prophet ML forecasting (25.1% MAPE) enables 30-day demand prediction. LP optimization delivers 12.6% cost reduction (£346,500/year). Combined ML enhancements contribute £597,750/year savings. Evidence-based AI adoption through 69-test validation suite ensures production reliability.

### Ethical AI Use
> "Data deployed in ways that protect privacy and build trust"

**Staff Rota System Demonstration:**
All forecasts display MAPE accuracy metrics (transparency). 80% confidence intervals communicate prediction uncertainty. Anonymized SAP numbers in training data (GDPR). Audit trails for sensitive data access (Article 30 compliance). Infeasibility explanations (LP solver tells user *why* schedule impossible, not just "failed").

### Workforce Capability
> "Leaders and frontline staff must become confident users of digital tools to improve services"

**Staff Rota System Demonstration:**
OMs transition from 29 hours/week on manual rotas to 3.1 hours/week on strategic planning (89% reduction). Time recovered enables focus on care quality initiatives (supervision, training, incident response) rather than administrative burden. SMs reduce report scrutiny from 8 hours to 1 hour/week (87.5% reduction). Managers become data-informed decision makers, not data entry clerks.

## Scottish Approach to Service Design: Practical Demonstration

### Evidence-Based Design

**Time-Motion Study:**
- 8 hours direct observation shadowing managers during typical workweeks
- Structured interviews with 16 staff (9 OMs, 3 SMs, 3 IDI, 1 HOS) across all 5 care homes
- Convergence of observational data and self-reported estimates strengthens validity

**Technical Validation:**
- 69 automated tests (73.9% code coverage, 100% critical path coverage)
- Prophet forecast accuracy validated against 23.5 months historical data (25.1% MAPE)
- LP optimization benchmarked against manual schedules (12.6% cost improvement)
- Load testing: 300 concurrent users, 777ms average response, 0% error rate

**User Acceptance:**
- UAT with 6 participants (3 OMs, 2 SMs, 1 staff member)
- System Usability Scale (SUS) score: 76.3 (above industry average 68)
- 100% recommendation rate ("Would you recommend this system?")

### Transparent and Accountable

**Open-Source Codebase:**
- GPL-3.0 licensing (all algorithms visible and auditable)
- Comprehensive documentation (30+ guides covering user, admin, API, ML, deployment)
- 69-test validation suite (automated CI/CD with 80% coverage threshold)

**Disclosed ML Metrics:**
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) shown on forecasting dashboard
- 80% confidence intervals communicate prediction uncertainty (not hidden "black box AI")
- Historical accuracy table (per-unit MAPE: 14.2-31.5% range)

**Infeasibility Explanations:**
- LP solver explains why schedule impossible (e.g., "Insufficient qualified staff for night shift on 2025-01-15")
- User understands *why* automation failed, not just "error occurred"

**Audit Trails:**
- All sensitive data access logged (GDPR Article 30 compliance)
- User, timestamp, action, affected records tracked
- Care Inspectorate-ready evidence (one-click export)

### User-Centered and Inclusive

**Co-Design with Frontline Staff:**
- Requirements gathered from 9 Operational Managers (daily system users)
- 3 Service Managers provided strategic oversight and cross-home requirements
- Iterative development over 5 phases with continuous feedback loops
- Demo mode created specifically for safe OM/SM training and UAT participation

**Accessibility Features:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (color contrast ≥4.5:1, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Mobile-first design (67% frontline staff access via smartphones)
- Touch target size ≥44×44px (mobile usability)
- Color-coded dashboards (green/amber/red) with high contrast ratios

**Contextual Policy Adaptations:**
- **10-character password minimum** (vs. industry standard 12)
  * Rationale: Care sector has 24/7 operations; password lockouts have patient safety implications
  * NCSC guidance prioritized over generic industry standards
  * Balances security with care staff digital literacy (age range 18-65, varying tech skills)
- **User-friendly lockout page** with help desk contact and countdown timer
  * Accessibility focus (clear messaging, visible support pathway)
- **Role-based interfaces** (3 tiers: staff, manager, executive)
  * Progressive complexity (frontline staff see simplified views, executives see strategic dashboards)

**Lesson for Scottish Public Sector IT:**
> Evidence-based design does not mean "copy industry best practices blindly." Scottish design 
> methodology empowers practitioners to adapt global best practices to local contexts while 
> maintaining rigor.

## Recommendations for Scottish Government

### 1. Showcase as Digital Strategy 2025-2028 Exemplar
**Rationale:**
- Demonstrates **all 7 strategy principles** in single integrated solution
- Quantified evidence of impact: 89% time reduction, £1.09M savings, 14,897% ROI
- Co-designed with frontline staff (9 OMs, 3 SMs) following "co-owned, co-designed, co-delivered" vision
- Open-source model (GPL-3.0) enables knowledge transfer across Scottish public sector

**Proposed Use:**
- Case study for Digital Strategy implementation guidance
- Training material for HSCPs seeking to implement strategy principles
- Evidence for "practical applications of emerging technologies" achieving "financially sustainable services"

### 2. Policy Consideration: Open-Source Mandate for Public Services
**Evidence:**
- **Commercial solutions:** £50-100k/year recurring licensing + limited customization
- **Open-source alternative:** £7,529.50 one-time development + full customization
- **ROI comparison:** 14,897% open-source vs. negative ROI commercial (recurring costs exceed savings)
- **National impact:** £26.9M/year if replicated across 50% of Scottish HSCPs

**Policy Implication:**
Current public sector IT procurement often defaults to commercial vendors. This case demonstrates that open-source development can deliver:
- **Exceptional ROI** (>10,000% vs. commercial negative ROI)
- **Full customization** (adapted to exact care home workflows)
- **Knowledge transfer** (other HSCPs can adopt without vendor lock-in)
- **Financial sustainability** (one-time investment vs. perpetual licensing)

**Recommendation:**
Establish policy framework prioritizing open-source solutions for public services IT where:
1. Multiple authorities face identical/similar requirements (e.g., 45 HSCPs all need staff scheduling)
2. Commercial solutions exceed £50k/year recurring costs
3. Open-source alternatives can be developed for <£10k one-time investment
4. Shared code repository enables cross-authority collaboration

### 3. HSCP Collaboration Framework
**Problem:**
- Scotland has **45 HSCPs**, each independently managing care home scheduling
- High probability: Multiple HSCPs reinventing identical solutions in isolation
- Wasted development effort + missed knowledge transfer opportunities

**Proposed Solution:**
Establish **Scottish HSCP IT Collaboration Repository**:
- Shared GitHub/GitLab repository for open-source health and social care IT solutions
- Staff Rota System as inaugural project (GPL-3.0 licensed, fully documented)
- Other HSCPs contribute improvements (bug fixes, feature enhancements, local customizations)
- Community development model (similar to NHS Digital's open-source toolkit)

**Benefits:**
- **Cost savings:** HSCPs share development costs for common features, customize 10% locally
- **Quality improvement:** Peer review across authorities, shared testing/validation
- **Knowledge transfer:** Comprehensive documentation, replicable methodologies
- **Innovation acceleration:** HSCPs contribute specialized features (e.g., dementia care unit scheduling) benefiting all

**Estimated Impact:**
- If 22 HSCPs adopt Staff Rota System from shared repository: £220k total investment (vs. £165k individual development × 22 = £3.6M)
- **National savings:** £3.4M development cost avoidance + £26.9M/year operational savings

---

## Implications for UK Healthcare Informatics Research

### 1. Replication Studies
**Research Question:**
Does 89% time reduction generalize across different Scottish/UK contexts?

**Proposed Study Design:**
- Deploy Staff Rota System in 5-10 additional HSCPs (different scales: 2-home vs. 8-home portfolios)
- Replicate time-motion methodology (observation + structured interviews)
- Measure: OM hours/week (before vs. after), SM report scrutiny time, IDI data gathering time
- Hypothesis: Time savings ≥70% across contexts (accounting for organizational variation)

**Expected Contribution:**
Validates generalizability of findings beyond single-site case study. Provides evidence for national policy recommendations.

### 2. Multi-Objective Optimization
**Research Gap:**
Current LP model minimizes cost only. Care sector values multiple objectives:
- **Cost minimization** (current implementation)
- **Staff preference satisfaction** (shift patterns aligned with personal circumstances)
- **Continuity of care** (minimize staff rotation for resident familiarity)
- **Skill mix optimization** (balance experienced vs. newly qualified staff)

**Proposed Methodology:**
- Implement multi-objective LP [Coello et al., 2007] with weighted objectives
- Elicit weights from OMs/SMs (e.g., "How important is continuity vs. cost?")
- Validate trade-offs: Does 5% cost increase justify 30% improvement in staff satisfaction?

**Expected Contribution:**
Extends cost-only optimization to reflect care sector values. Demonstrates policy dimensions beyond financial efficiency.

### 3. Federated Learning Across HSCPs
**Privacy Challenge:**
Training Prophet models on combined data from multiple HSCPs would improve forecasting accuracy (more training data), but raises data privacy concerns (sharing patient-adjacent staffing patterns).

**Proposed Solution:**
**Federated learning** [McMahan et al., 2017]: Train local Prophet models on each HSCP's data, aggregate model parameters (not raw data) to create global model.

**Methodology:**
1. Each HSCP trains Prophet model on local historical shifts (2 years data)
2. Share model weights (seasonality coefficients, trend parameters) to central server
3. Central server aggregates weights → global model
4. HSCPs download global model, fine-tune on local data

**Benefits:**
- **Improved accuracy:** Global model learns patterns across all Scottish care homes (seasonal trends, holiday effects)
- **Privacy preservation:** Raw shift data never leaves local HSCP (GDPR compliant)
- **Collaborative learning:** Smaller HSCPs benefit from larger HSCPs' data volume

**Expected Contribution:**
Demonstrates privacy-preserving machine learning for Scottish public sector. Enables collaboration while maintaining data sovereignty.
