## How to Read Your Personal Rota

1. **Find Your Name** - Check the online system or printed rota for your schedule
2. **Identify the Week** - Look for Week 1, Week 2, or Week 3 label
3. **Check Your Days** - Your work days are marked for that specific week
4. **Note the Pattern** - Your days will follow the same pattern when that week number repeats

### Example Reading:

If you see: **"Week 1: Sun, Mon, Tue"**
- You work Sunday, Monday, Tuesday in Week 1
- When Week 1 comes around again (3 weeks later), you'll work the same days
