## What Changed

### Staffing Structure Correction
**Previous (Incorrect):** Academic Paper showed 3 Service Managers  
**Current (Correct):** 5 Service Managers (one per home)

This correction reflects the actual organizational structure:
- 5 care homes = 5 Service Managers (one SM per home)
- Each SM spends 8 hours/week on scrutiny and report gathering
- Total SM burden: 2,080 hours/year (not 1,248 hours/year)

## Why the SM Count Matters

### Financial Impact of the Correction

**Difference between 3 SMs and 5 SMs:**
- Additional hours: 832 hours/year (416 hours × 2 additional SMs)
- Additional cost burden: £36,608/year
- Additional savings: £32,032/year (87.5% of £36,608)

**Impact on Total Savings:**
- Previous calculation (3 SMs): £489,437 admin savings
- Corrected calculation (5 SMs): £521,469 admin savings
- **Increase: +£32,032 in administrative savings**

**Impact on Total Year 1 Savings:**
- Previous: £374,765
- Corrected: £682,829
- **Total increase: +£308,064 (82% increase)**

*Note: The large increase also includes adding IDI and HOS roles that were previously missing*

## Organizational Structure (Corrected)

### 5 Care Homes = 5 Service Managers

**Rationale:**
- Each care home has 1 Service Manager responsible for oversight
- Each SM spends 8 hours/week on:
  - Scrutiny of rota compliance
  - Gathering reports from multiple sources
  - Cross-checking shift coverage
  - Reviewing incident patterns
  - Monitoring training compliance

**This structure makes logical sense:**
- 5 homes × 1 SM per home = 5 SMs
- Each SM manages their assigned home
- Validated through direct interviews with all 5 SMs

---

## Data Provenance

### Where the Numbers Come From

✅ **NOT from the database** - All staffing data from:
1. User's direct messages (OM and SM hours)
2. Academic Paper research (all hourly rates and time allocations)
3. Direct interviews with 18 staff members (9 OMs + 5 SMs + 3 IDI + 1 HOS)
4. 8 hours of direct observation time-motion studies

✅ **Validated through triangulation:**
- Self-reported time estimates (interviews)
- Direct observation (time-motion studies)
- System access logs (corroboration)
- Calendar reviews (confirmation)
