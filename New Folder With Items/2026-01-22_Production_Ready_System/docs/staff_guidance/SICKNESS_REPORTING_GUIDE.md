## Reporting Sickness Absence

### Before Your Shift Starts

**Step 1: Call Your Line Manager**

**Why phone, not text?**
- Manager needs to ask follow-up questions
- They need to assess severity
- Texts can be missed
- It's company policy (contractual requirement)

**When to call:**
- **Day shifts (07:00 start):** Call by 06:45 latest
- **Night shifts (19:00 start):** Call by 18:45 latest
- **Earlierthe better** - gives time to arrange cover

**Can't reach manager?**
- Try 3 times
- Call main office/duty manager
- Leave voicemail AND call office
- Send text ONLY as backup (not replacement)

**Step 2: Provide Key Information**

Your manager will ask:

1. **Nature of illness**
   - You don't need to give full medical history
   - General description is enough ("stomach bug", "flu symptoms")
   - Be honest - helps with risk assessment

2. **Symptoms**
   - Relevant for infection control
   - Determines if you can return
   - May need specific clearance (48hr rule for D&V)

3. **Expected return**
   - Best estimate
   - OK to say "unsure"
   - Can update daily if needed

4. **GP consulted?**
   - Have you seen/will you see a doctor?
   - Any medication prescribed?
   - Any fit note issued?

**Step 3: Understand Next Steps**

Manager will confirm:
- Your absence is recorded
- Cover arrangements (not your problem!)
- When to call back
- Certification requirements
- Any actions you need to take

### During Your Shift

**If You Become Unwell At Work:**

1. **Tell shift coordinator immediately**
   - Don't struggle on
   - Don't just disappear
   - Patient safety priority

2. **Complete incident form**
   - Especially if injury or exposure
   - Occupational health may be involved

3. **Get permission to leave**
   - Don't leave site without approval
   - Handover your duties
   - Sign out properly

4. **Follow up with phone call**
   - Call your line manager later
   - Confirm you're off sick tomorrow (if applicable)
   - Follow normal sickness procedures

## Absence Triggers & Bradford Factor

### What is the Bradford Factor?

**The Bradford Factor** is a formula that measures the **disruption** of absence, not just the time off.

**Formula:** B = S² × D
- **S** = Number of absence spells (periods)
- **D** = Total days absent
- **B** = Bradford Factor score

**Why it matters:**
- Frequent short absences cause more disruption than one long absence
- Used to identify patterns needing support
- Triggers management review, not automatic discipline

**Example:**

**Person A:**
- 1 absence of 10 days
- Bradford = 1² × 10 = **10**

**Person B:**
- 10 absences of 1 day each
- Bradford = 10² × 10 = **1000**

Person B has same time off but 100× the Bradford score because frequency disrupts team more.

### Trigger Points

**When Bradford Factor reaches certain levels, triggers apply:**

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **0-50** | No action - normal monitoring |
| **51-200** | **First Review** - Informal chat with manager |
| **201-400** | **Second Review** - Formal review meeting |
| **401-600** | **Third Review** - Written warning possible |
| **601+** | **Fourth Review** - Further disciplinary action |

**Reviews are supportive, not punitive:**
- Identify underlying causes
- Offer support (OH referral, EAP, adjustments)
- Check if work-related issues
- Only disciplinary if no genuine illness

### Absence Triggers

**Separate from Bradford Factor:**

**Trigger 1: Frequency**
- **4 or more absences in 12 months**
- Triggers review meeting

**Trigger 2: Duration**
- **10+ days in 12-month period**
- Triggers review meeting

**Trigger 3: Patterns**
- Absences before/after leave
- Repeated Mondays or Fridays
- After shift change requests denied
- Triggers investigation

**What Happens:**
1. Manager invites you to meeting
2. Discuss absence pattern
3. Identify support needed
4. May refer to OH
5. Agree action plan
6. Monitor improvement

**Protected Absences (Don't Count):**
- Pregnancy-related sickness
- Disability-related (with medical evidence)
- Injury at work (IOD)
- COVID-19 (during pandemic period)
- Some long-term conditions (case by case)

- ❌ Refusing OH referral
- ❌ Failing to certificate properly

### Capability Procedure

**Different from discipline:**
- Used when genuinely unable to work
- After all support tried
- OH confirms no reasonable adjustments
- Last resort: ill-health retirement or termination

**Process:**
1. Multiple OH assessments
2. Trial of adjustments
3. Redeployment considered
4. Formal capability hearing
5. Appeal rights
