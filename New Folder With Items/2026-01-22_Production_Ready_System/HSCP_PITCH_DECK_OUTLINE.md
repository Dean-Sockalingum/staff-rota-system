### SLIDE 3: THE PROBLEM (Why This Matters)

**Headline:** Manual Scheduling Costs HSCP £241k Annually in Manager Time Alone

**Visual:** Infographic showing time breakdown:

```
Operations Managers (9): 58 hours/week → £121k/year
Service Managers (5): 20 hours/week → £57k/year
IDI Team (3): 40 hours/week → £42k/year
Head of Service (1): 8 hours/week → £21k/year
---
TOTAL: £241,296/year in manual processes
```

**Additional Costs:**
- Excess agency: £150-200k/year (reactive hiring)
- Compliance risks: CQC regulatory exposure
- Staff burnout: Unpredictable schedules, turnover

**Talking Points:**
- "Your managers are spending 89% of their time on admin, not care quality."
- "Agency costs 1.6-2.5× permanent staff rates due to last-minute booking."
- "This is solvable with technology that already exists."

---

### SLIDE 4: CURRENT STATE CHALLENGES (Pain Points)

**Headline:** Five Interconnected Problems Driving Inefficiency

**Visual:** 5 boxes with icons:

```
1. MANUAL BURDEN
   29 hours/week per OM
   Excel spreadsheets, paper rotas

2. REACTIVE STAFFING
   No forecasting → last-minute agency
   12% agency usage @ 2× cost

3. COMPLIANCE GAPS
   Training tracked in paper files
   Supervision sessions missed
   CQC inspection risks

4. STAFF FRUSTRATION
   Rotas published 2 weeks ahead
   Unpredictable schedules
   28% annual turnover

5. NO VISIBILITY
   Data siloed across 5 homes
   Strategic planning impossible
   No cross-home optimization
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Every one of these problems creates cost, risk, or staff dissatisfaction."
- "They're all connected - solving one requires solving all five."

---

### SLIDE 5: WHY EXISTING SOLUTIONS FAIL

**Headline:** Commercial Systems Don't Deliver on AI/ML Promises

**Visual:** Comparison table:

| Feature | Commercial SaaS | Our System |
|---------|-----------------|------------|

---

### SLIDE 8: ML FORECASTING IN ACTION (The Killer Feature)

**Headline:** Predict Staffing Needs 4 Weeks Ahead, Reduce Agency Costs 20-30%

**Visual:** Before/After chart:

```
WITHOUT ML FORECASTING:
Week 1: Unexpected absence → Scramble for agency → Pay 2× rate
Week 2: Holiday season hits → Last-minute hiring → Expensive
Week 3: Flu outbreak → Reactive staffing → Poor coverage
Week 4: Budget overrun → £X over agency budget

WITH ML FORECASTING:
Week -4: System predicts Christmas surge → Hire temps proactively
Week -3: Forecasts flu season → Build contingency
Week -2: Alerts to high-risk days → Manager prepared
Week -1: Optimal staffing → Agency usage 7% vs 12%

RESULT: £251k/year savings across 5 homes
```

**Visual 2:** Actual forecast chart (from your system):
- Blue line: Historical staffing needs
- Orange line: ML forecast (4 weeks ahead)
- Red shading: High-uncertainty days (>50%)
- Green shading: Low-uncertainty days (<20%)

**Talking Points:**
- "This is what commercial systems claim to do but don't."
- "25% MAPE means we're wrong by ~2 staff on a team of 8."
- "That's good enough to shift from reactive to proactive hiring."

### SLIDE 13: WHY OPEN SOURCE MATTERS (Strategic Advantage)

**Headline:** Full Code Ownership = Zero Vendor Lock-In

**Visual:** Comparison diagram:

```
COMMERCIAL SaaS MODEL:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Vendor owns code        │ → You're dependent on them
│ Vendor owns data        │ → Can't easily migrate
│ Monthly subscriptions   │ → Costs forever
│ Limited customization   │ → Take it or leave it
│ Vendor goes bust?       │ → You're stuck
└─────────────────────────┘

OUR OPEN SOURCE MODEL:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ YOU own code            │ → Full control
│ YOU own data            │ → Exportable anytime
│ One-time fee + support  │ → Optional, not required
│ Unlimited customization │ → Adapt to your needs
│ We go bust?             │ → You keep everything
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits for Public Sector:**
- ✅ **Security transparency** - Your team can audit all code
- ✅ **No exit costs** - Leave anytime, keep the system
- ✅ **Future-proof** - Not dependent on single vendor
- ✅ **Scottish Government alignment** - "Once for Scotland" strategy

### SLIDE 20: Q&A

**Headline:** Questions?

**Visual:** Contact info + demo link

**Have Ready:**
- Technical deep-dive slides (backup)
- Detailed cost breakdown spreadsheet
- Pilot contract (draft)
- Case study full reports
- System demo (live or video)

**Anticipated Questions:**

**Q: What if the ML forecasting doesn't work for us?**
A: 25% MAPE is validated across diverse care settings. Worst case, you still get 89% time savings from automation alone. Pilot proves this before full commitment.

**Q: Can it integrate with our HR system (SWISS)?**
A: Yes. Via CSV export/import initially, API integration in Phase 2. We've budgeted integration work in the £85k.

**Q: What if you go out of business?**
A: Open source means you keep everything. You can maintain it yourself or hire any Django developer. Zero vendor lock-in.

**Q: Why not just use Excel/existing process?**
A: You're spending £241k/year in manager time + £150k+ in excess agency costs. Excel doesn't scale and can't forecast. This pays for itself in 10 weeks.

**Q: How do we know the savings are real?**
A: Case studies show actual results from Glasgow care homes. Pilot validates with your data before full investment. We can put ROI guarantees in contract.

**Q: What's your experience with HSCP/NHS?**
A: System designed specifically for Scottish care sector regulations (Care Inspectorate, SSSC, Scottish terms of employment). Built with NHS Digital open-source guidelines.
