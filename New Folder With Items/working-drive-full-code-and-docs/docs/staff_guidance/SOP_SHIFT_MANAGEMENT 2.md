**Document ID:** SOP-002  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** December 2025  
**Review Date:** March 2026  
**Owner:** Operations Manager

---

## Purpose

This SOP defines procedures for creating, managing, and viewing staff shifts and rotas to ensure adequate staffing levels, fair distribution of shifts, and compliance with working time regulations.

## Scope

- Weekly and monthly rota creation
- Shift patterns and types
- Shift swaps and reallocations
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Rota viewing (staff, unit, team perspectives)

## Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Unit Manager** | Create rotas, approve shift swaps, ensure adequate cover |
| **Senior Carer** | Support rota creation, cover shift swaps when needed |
| **Care Staff** | Work assigned shifts, request swaps in advance, notify of issues |
| **Operations Manager** | Monitor staffing levels, review compliance, resolve disputes |

---

## Shift Types & Patterns

### Standard Shift Times

| Shift Type | Start Time | End Time | Duration | Typical Staff |
|------------|------------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Early** | 07:00 | 15:00 | 8 hours | 4-5 per unit |
| **Late** | 15:00 | 23:00 | 8 hours | 3-4 per unit |
| **Night** | 23:00 | 07:00 | 8 hours | 2-3 per unit |
| **Long Day** | 07:00 | 19:00 | 12 hours | Variable (by request) |
| **Twilight** | 19:00 | 23:00 | 4 hours | 1-2 (additional cover) |

### Shift Patterns

**Full-Time (37.5 hours/week):**
- 5 days on, 2 days off (rotating)
- 4 days on, 3 days off (compressed)
- 12-hour shifts: 3 on, 4 off (long day pattern)

**Part-Time:**
- Fixed days (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri)
- Variable hours per week
- Bank/zero-hours as needed

**Night Staff:**
- Permanent nights (3-4 nights per week)
- Rotating nights (2 weeks days, 1 week nights)
- Enhanced pay rate (usually +20-30%)

---

## Minimum Staffing Requirements

### Safe Staffing Levels (Per Unit)

**15-Bed Unit:**

| Time | Minimum Staff | Recommended | Role Mix |
|------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Early (7am-3pm)** | 4 staff | 5 staff | 1 senior + 3-4 care staff |
| **Late (3pm-11pm)** | 3 staff | 4 staff | 1 senior + 2-3 care staff |
| **Night (11pm-7am)** | 2 staff | 3 staff | 1 senior + 1-2 care staff |

**Factors Affecting Numbers:**
- Resident dependency levels (higher dependency = more staff)
- Unit layout (single rooms vs shared)
- Infection control (isolation nursing)
- Activities planned
- Admissions/discharges
- Staff experience (new staff need supervision)

**Never Go Below Minimum:**
- Legal requirement for registered care homes
- Care Inspectorate standard
- Insurance policy compliance
- Staff and resident safety

---

## Procedure: Creating Weekly Rota (Unit Managers)

### Step 1: Access Rota Management

1. **Navigate to:** Management → Shift Management
2. **Select:** "Create/Edit Rota"
3. **Choose:**
   - Unit: [Your unit]
   - Week Starting: [DD/MM/YYYY]
   - View: Weekly or Monthly

---

### Step 2: Review Previous Week

**Before Creating New Rota:**

1. **Check Last Week's Rota**
   - What worked well?
   - Any staffing issues?
   - Staff feedback?
   - Absences/late changes?

2. **Check Staff Availability**
   - Who's on annual leave?
   - Any known sickness?
   - Training courses scheduled?
   - Supervision sessions booked?

3. **Check Upcoming Events**
   - Resident activities (need extra staff?)
   - Inspections/audits
   - Maintenance work
   - Admissions expected?

---

### Step 3: Build the Rota

**Method A: Auto-Generate (Recommended for Regular Pattern)**

1. Click **"Auto-Generate Rota"**
2. Select pattern:
   - Repeat last week (with adjustments)
   - Standard pattern (4 on, 3 off)
   - Custom pattern (specify rules)

3. System generates draft rota based on:
   - Staff contracted hours
   - Previous shift patterns (fairness)
   - Annual leave blocked out
   - Staff preferences (if recorded)
   - Minimum staffing levels met

4. Review auto-generated rota
5. Make manual adjustments as needed
6. Save draft

**Time Required:** 10-15 minutes for standard week

---

**Method B: Manual Creation**

1. Start with blank rota grid
2. For each day, each shift:
   - Click time slot
   - Select staff member
   - Repeat until minimum staffing met
   - Add extra staff if needed

3. System checks:
   - ✅ Minimum staffing met?
   - ✅ No double-bookings?
   - ✅ Working time regulations OK?
   - ✅ Fair distribution of shifts?
   - ⚠️ Warnings for issues

4. Save draft

**Time Required:** 30-45 minutes for full week

---

### Step 4: Check for Conflicts

**System Automatically Flags:**

**🔴 Critical Errors (Must Fix):**
- Below minimum staffing
- Staff double-booked (two shifts same time)
- Staff on annual leave but assigned shift
- Exceeds 48-hour working week
- Less than 11-hour rest between shifts

**🟡 Warnings (Review):**
- Only at minimum staffing (no buffer)
- Staff working 6+ consecutive days
- Unbalanced shift distribution (one staff doing all weekends)
- Staff preference not honored
- New staff without supervision

**🟢 Recommendations:**
- Consider swapping shifts for better balance
- Add extra staff for known busy periods
- Give staff member requested day off

---

### Step 5: Publish Rota

**Before Publishing:**

1. **Final Review**
   - All shifts covered?
   - Fair distribution?
   - No conflicts?
   - Checked with senior carer?

2. **Click "Publish Rota"**

3. **System Actions:**
   - Status: Draft → Published
   - All staff notified via email/SMS
   - Rota visible on mobile app
   - Locked for editing (changes require approval)
   - Printed copy auto-generated

**Publishing Deadline:**
- Publish at least 2 weeks in advance
- Legal requirement: 1 week minimum
- Best practice: 3-4 weeks for staff planning

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ All staff know their shifts
- ✅ Adequate cover achieved
- ✅ Compliance maintained

---

## Procedure: Viewing Your Rota (All Staff)

### Method 1: Web Dashboard

1. **Log in to system**
2. **Dashboard shows:** "Your Next Shift: Monday 4 Dec, Early (7am-3pm)"
3. **Click "View Full Rota"**
4. See calendar with your shifts color-coded:
   - Blue: Early shifts
   - Orange: Late shifts
   - Purple: Night shifts
   - Gray: Days off

---

### Method 2: Mobile View

1. **Access via phone browser:** http://127.0.0.1:8000/
2. **Responsive design:** Optimized for mobile
3. **Quick view:** Today and tomorrow's shifts
4. **Calendar view:** Swipe through weeks

---

### Method 3: Print Rota

1. Navigate to **Rota → View Rota**
2. Select view type:
   - My Rota (just your shifts)
   - Unit Rota (everyone in your unit)
   - Team Rota (specific team)
3. Click **"Print"**
4. Format: A4 landscape, includes notes
5. Pin to noticeboard in staff room

---

### Method 4: AI Assistant

Ask:
- **"What shifts am I working this week?"**
- **"When's my next shift?"**
- **"Am I working next Monday?"**
- **"Who else is on early shift tomorrow?"**

---

## Shift Swaps

### When Shift Swaps Are Allowed

**Valid Reasons:**
- Personal appointment (doctor, school, etc.)
- Childcare issues
- Transport problems
- Family emergency
- Work-life balance

**Not Valid:**
- Last-minute social plans (must plan ahead)
- Preference only (no legitimate reason)
- Frequent swaps (indicates wrong shift pattern)

**Rules:**
- Request at least 48 hours in advance
- Find own replacement (don't expect manager to do it)
- Replacement must be same skill level
- Manager must approve
- Maximum 2 swaps per month per staff member

---

### Procedure: Requesting Shift Swap

**Step 1: Find Replacement**

1. **Ask Colleague Directly**
   - "Can you cover my early shift on Tuesday? I have a doctor's appointment"
   - Ensure they're available and willing
   - Check they have the right skills/qualifications

2. **Or Use System**
   - Navigate to Shift Swaps → Find Cover
   - System shows available staff for that shift
   - Send swap request to colleague via system

---

**Step 2: Submit Swap Request**

1. **Go to:** Rota → Shift Swaps → Request Swap
2. **Fill in Details:**
   ```
   Your Shift to Swap:
   - Date: Tuesday 5 Dec
   - Shift: Early (7am-3pm)
   - Unit: DEMENTIA
   
   Replacement Staff: J. Smith
   
   Reason: Doctor's appointment (cannot reschedule)
   
   Reciprocal Swap? (Will you cover their shift in return?)
   - Yes: I'll cover J. Smith's late shift Friday 8 Dec
   - No: One-way swap
   ```

3. **Submit Request**
   - Sent to manager for approval
   - Replacement staff also notified (must confirm)

---

**Step 3: Await Approval**

**Approval Process:**

1. **Replacement Confirms:** "Yes, I can cover"
2. **Manager Reviews:**
   - Does swap maintain safe staffing?
   - Is replacement qualified?
   - Is reason valid?
   - Too many swaps recently?

3. **Manager Decides:**
   - **Approve:** Shifts swapped, rota updated automatically
   - **Decline:** Reason provided, original shifts remain

**Response Time:** Usually within 24 hours

**If Approved:**
- ✅ You work J. Smith's shift (late, Friday 8 Dec)
- ✅ J. Smith works your shift (early, Tuesday 5 Dec)
- ✅ Both shifts updated on rota
- ✅ Email confirmation sent

---

### Emergency Shift Changes

**If Sick on Day of Shift:**

1. **Call Manager Immediately** (not via system)
   - As soon as you know you can't work
   - Explain illness
   - Expected return date?

2. **Manager Actions:**
   - Mark you as sick on rota
   - Find cover:
     - Ask other staff to come in (overtime)
     - Call agency (last resort)
   - Update rota accordingly

3. **Follow Sickness Policy:**
   - Self-certify for days 1-7
   - Fit note from day 8+
   - Return-to-work meeting on return

**Never:**
- Just not turn up (disciplinary issue)
- Text instead of call (must speak to manager)
- Ask colleague to call for you (unless truly unable)

---

## Rota Changes After Publishing

### Why Changes Happen

**Common Reasons:**
- Staff sickness
- Staff annual leave (approved after rota published)
- Increased resident needs (staffing level increase)
- Training courses
- Emergencies

---

### Procedure: Editing Published Rota

**For Unit Managers:**

1. **Navigate to:** Rota → Edit Published Rota
2. **Select:** Week and date to change
3. **Make Change:**
   - Remove staff member (e.g., sick)
   - Add replacement (overtime, agency, or swap)
   - Update shift times if needed

4. **Add Change Reason:**
   - Required for audit trail
   - Examples: "J. Smith sick - covered by K. Brown overtime"

5. **Publish Change:**
   - Click "Update Rota"
   - Affected staff notified immediately
   - Updated rota sent to all
   - Change logged in system

**Who Gets Notified?**
- Staff member added to shift (new or changed)
- Staff member removed from shift
- All unit staff (FYI - rota updated)
- Senior management (if significant change)

---

## Viewing Different Rota Perspectives

### Staff View (Individual)

**Shows:**
- Just your own shifts
- Your days off
- Your total hours this week/month
- Any pending shift swaps

**Best for:** Personal planning, printing your schedule

---

### Unit View (Location)

**Shows:**
- All shifts in one unit (e.g., DEMENTIA)
- All staff assigned to unit
- Staffing level for each shift
- Gaps/shortfalls highlighted

**Best for:** Unit managers, ensuring coverage, identifying issues

---

### Team View (Group)

**Shows:**
- Specific team (e.g., "Night Team")
- Multiple units if team works across them
- Team members' shifts
- Team coverage patterns

**Best for:** Team coordination, night staff management

---

### Calendar View

**Shows:**
- Month at a glance
- Color-coded shifts
- Days off in gray
- Annual leave in green
- Sickness in red

**Best for:** Long-term planning, spotting patterns

---

### List View

**Shows:**
- Simple list format
- Date, shift type, staff name
- Sortable/filterable
- Export to Excel

**Best for:** Data analysis, payroll, reporting

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Double-Booking

**System Prevents:**
- Cannot assign same staff to two shifts at same time
- Error: "J. Smith already assigned to Late shift BLUE unit"

**If Happens Manually (Outside System):**
- Staff tells you: "I'm on two rotas for Tuesday"
- Check which is correct
- Cancel incorrect one
- Notify all affected

---

### Under-Staffing

**If Published Rota Has Gap:**

1. **Identify Gap:**
   - System flags: "Night shift Tuesday only has 1 staff (minimum 2)"

2. **Find Cover:**
   - Priority 1: Ask existing staff for overtime
   - Priority 2: Shift swap (move staff from another shift)
   - Priority 3: Book agency

3. **Update Rota:**
   - Add cover staff
   - Publish change
   - Verify minimum staffing now met

---

### Over-Staffing

**If Too Many Staff:**

1. **Why Is It Over?**
   - Mistake in rota?
   - Extra staff booked for specific reason (activities, admissions)?
   - Agency booked unnecessarily?

2. **Options:**
   - Keep extra staff (if budget allows - good for quality)
   - Cancel agency booking (if booked in error)
   - Send staff home (if they agree - pay issue)
   - Keep as cover (in case someone calls sick)

**Best Practice:** Slight over-staffing better than under-staffing

- Bank holidays: Ensure fair distribution

**Document Preferences:**
- Record staff preferences (e.g., "prefers not to work Fridays")
- Try to accommodate but can't always guarantee
- Balance individual needs with service needs

**Avoid Favoritism:**
- Don't give "easy" rotas to favorites
- Apply same rules to everyone
- Document decisions (why X got request granted, Y declined)

---

### Communication

**Publish Changes Clearly:**
- Highlight what's changed (don't make staff hunt)
- Explain why if significant
- Give as much notice as possible
- Apologize for short-notice changes

**Open Door Policy:**
- Staff can discuss rota concerns
- Listen to feedback
- Explain decisions
- Be willing to adjust if reasonable

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Last-Minute Sickness (Day of Shift)

**6:30 AM:** J. Smith calls sick, shift starts 7 AM

**Actions:**
1. **6:31 AM:** Thank J. Smith, wish them better
2. **6:32 AM:** Check who's available:
   - Who's on day off today?
   - Who might want overtime?
3. **6:33 AM:** Call/text 2-3 staff
4. **6:40 AM:** K. Brown agrees to cover (time-and-a-half)
5. **6:42 AM:** Update rota in system
6. **6:43 AM:** Notify unit: "J. Smith sick, K. Brown covering"
7. **7:00 AM:** Shift covered, situation resolved

**Total Time:** 12 minutes from call to cover

---

### Scenario 2: Multiple Staff on Leave (Christmas Week)

**Situation:** 5 staff requested Christmas week (23-30 Dec)

**Planning (November):**
1. Review requests (first-come-first-served vs. rotation)
2. Approve maximum 3 staff on leave at once
3. Prioritize those who didn't get last Christmas
4. Decline 2 requests, suggest alternative dates
5. Book agency/overtime for approved leave
6. Communicate decisions with empathy

**Result:**
- Fair allocation
- Adequate cover
- Planned in advance (not emergency)

---

### Scenario 3: Staff Requests Pattern Change

**Request:** "Can I move from 5 days to 4 days per week?"

**Process:**
1. **Understand Reason:** Personal (childcare, study, health)
2. **Check Feasibility:**
   - Can we accommodate with current staff?
   - Need to recruit additional hours?
   - Budget impact?
3. **Trial Period:** "Try for 3 months, review"
4. **Formalize:** Update contract if permanent
5. **Update Rota Patterns:** Ensure fairness to others

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Rota won't publish - errors showing

**Common Errors:**

**"Below minimum staffing"**
- Solution: Add more staff to flagged shifts

**"Staff double-booked"**
- Solution: Remove from one shift, keep on other

**"Exceeds working time"**
- Solution: Reduce hours or get staff opt-out signed

**"Annual leave clash"**
- Solution: Remove staff from shifts on their leave dates

---

### Issue: Staff didn't receive rota notification

**Checks:**
1. Email address correct in system?
2. Check spam/junk folder
3. SMS number correct?
4. Published or still in draft?

**Solution:**
- Update contact details
- Re-send notification manually
- Print copy for staff room

---

### Issue: Need to completely redo published rota

**Rare but happens (e.g., unit closure, emergency)**

**Process:**
1. Unpublish current rota (admin function)
2. Create new rota from scratch
3. Communicate widely: "Major change - please check new rota"
4. Publish new rota
5. Speak to affected staff individually if major changes
6. Document reason for complete redo

---
