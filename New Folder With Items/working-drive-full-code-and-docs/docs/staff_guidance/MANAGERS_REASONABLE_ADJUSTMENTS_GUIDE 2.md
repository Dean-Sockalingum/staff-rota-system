# Manager's Guide: Reasonable Adjustments

## Introduction

This guide explains **what reasonable adjustments are**, **when to consider them**, and **how to implement them** to support employees with health conditions or disabilities.

**What are reasonable adjustments?**

Reasonable adjustments are **changes to working arrangements** or **the work environment** that help an employee with a health condition or disability to:
- Perform their job
- Achieve acceptable attendance
- Return to work after absence
- Remain in work

**Why are they important?**

- ✅ **Legal duty** under Equality Act 2010 (for disabled employees)
- ✅ **Support employee wellbeing** and recovery
- ✅ **Reduce absence** and improve attendance
- ✅ **Retain skilled staff** and avoid capability dismissals
- ✅ **Demonstrate fairness** and good employment practice

> **💡 Important:** You **must** consider reasonable adjustments if an employee is disabled under the Equality Act. Failure to do so = potential discrimination claim.

## When to Consider Adjustments

### You SHOULD Consider Adjustments When:

| Situation | Why Adjustments Needed | Examples |
|-----------|------------------------|----------|
| **Employee discloses disability** | Equality Act duty to make reasonable adjustments | Adjust hours, equipment, duties |
| **Long-term health condition** | Help employee manage condition at work | Flexible hours, rest breaks, lighter duties |
| **Frequent absences** | May help reduce absence if work-related | Workstation assessment, stress reduction |
| **Returning after long-term absence** | Aid recovery and prevent relapse | Phased return, temporary adjusted duties |
| **GP or OH recommends adjustments** | Medical advice on what will help | Follow specific recommendations |
| **Employee requests adjustments** | Employee knows what might help them | Explore request seriously |
| **Risk to health from current duties** | Prevent worsening of condition | Remove triggering tasks, adjust workload |
| **Capability concerns** | Explore all options before dismissal | Redeployment, permanent adjustments |

---

### Who Gets Reasonable Adjustments?

**Disabled employees (Equality Act 2010):**
- ✅ **MUST** consider adjustments - it's a legal duty
- ✅ Adjustments must be "reasonable" (see below)
- ✅ Failure to adjust = discrimination

**Non-disabled employees with health conditions:**
- ✅ **SHOULD** consider adjustments - good practice
- ✅ May help improve attendance and avoid capability
- ✅ Not legally required, but sensible

**Examples of disabilities:**
- Physical disabilities (wheelchair users, visual impairment, hearing loss)
- Long-term health conditions (diabetes, epilepsy, cancer, MS, arthritis)
- Mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, PTSD)
- Learning disabilities and neurodiversity (dyslexia, autism, ADHD)
- Hidden disabilities (chronic pain, ME, fibromyalgia)

> **💡 Definition:** Disability = physical or mental impairment that has a **substantial** and **long-term** (12+ months) **adverse effect** on ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.

---

## Types of Reasonable Adjustments

### 1. Flexible Working Hours

**What it is:**
- Changing start/finish times
- Compressed hours (e.g., full-time over 4 days)
- Working from home (if role allows)
- Part-time working (temporarily or permanently)

**When to use:**
- Employee fit for some hours but not full-time
- Medical appointments need attending
- Condition worse at certain times of day
- Commuting is difficult due to disability

**Examples:**
- **Diabetes:** Later start to allow morning insulin routine
- **Chronic fatigue:** Reduced hours to manage energy levels
- **Mental health:** Avoid rush hour commuting (trigger for anxiety)
- **Medical appointments:** Regular time off for hospital visits

**How to implement:**
- Discuss with employee: what hours can they manage?
- Get OH advice if unsure
- Agree temporary or permanent arrangement
- Adjust pay if hours reduced
- Confirm in writing with review date

**See also:** [Work Life Balance Policy and Flexible Working Procedure](link)

---

### 2. Phased Return to Work

**What it is:**
- Gradual return after long-term absence
- Hours/days increase week by week until full hours

**When to use:**
- After surgery or long illness
- Following mental health crisis
- After extended absence (8+ weeks)
- OH or GP recommends phased return

**Typical timescale:**
- **Week 1:** 50% hours (e.g., 2-3 days)
- **Week 2:** 60-70% hours
- **Week 3:** 75-80% hours
- **Week 4:** Full hours

**Example for 35hr/week staff:**
- Week 1: 17.5 hrs (3 × 6hr shifts or 2 × 8hr + 1 × short)
- Week 2: 24.5 hrs (4 × 6hr shifts)
- Week 3: 28 hrs (4 × 7hr shifts)
- Week 4: 35 hrs (5 × 7hr shifts or back to normal pattern)

**How to implement:**
- Discuss with employee **before** return date
- Get OH recommendation on appropriate timescale
- Agree specific hours/days for each week
- Usually **paid** for up to **4 weeks** (at normal rate)
- Confirm plan in writing
- Review weekly - adjust if employee struggling
- Seek HR advice on pay arrangements

**⚠️ Important:** Phased return should normally be **no more than 4 weeks**. Longer periods may affect pay - seek HR advice.

---

### 3. Lighter Duties

**What it is:**
- Removing or reducing physically/mentally demanding tasks
- Reassigning some duties to colleagues
- Avoiding triggers for condition

**When to use:**
- GP or OH says employee can't do full duties
- Medical condition prevents specific tasks
- Temporary restriction (e.g., after injury)
- Permanent restriction (e.g., long-term condition)

**Examples:**
- **Back pain:** No manual handling, no heavy lifting
- **Cardiac condition:** Reduce physical exertion, avoid stairs
- **Stress/anxiety:** Remove high-pressure tasks, reduce caseload
- **Pregnancy:** No lone working, no physical care tasks
- **Surgery recovery:** Office-based duties only for 6 weeks

**How to implement:**
- Get OH advice on what duties to avoid
- Identify which duties can be removed/reduced
- **Consult with colleagues** who'll take on duties (sensitively)
- Temporary: set review date (e.g., 3 months)
- Permanent: may need job redesign or redeployment
- Confirm in writing
- Review regularly

**⚠️ Considerations:**
- **Fairness to team:** Is it reasonable to ask colleagues to cover?
- **Service delivery:** Can service still operate effectively?
- **Employee's role:** Are they still able to do their substantive role?

---

### 4. Job Redesign

**What it is:**
- Permanently changing the duties of the role
- Reallocating some duties to other employees
- Creating a modified version of the role

**When to use:**
- Long-term/permanent health condition
- Employee can't do full range of duties even with other adjustments
- OH says some duties should be permanently removed
- Alternative to redeployment or dismissal

**Examples:**
- **Care assistant with back injury:** Remove all manual handling, focus on social activities and meal support
- **Manager with stress condition:** Reduce team size, remove budget responsibility
- **Admin with visual impairment:** Remove filing duties, focus on phone and IT work

**How to implement:**
- **Get OH advice** - is this medically necessary?
- Identify core duties employee **can** do
- Identify duties to remove
- Discuss with employee and affected colleagues
- May need **formal job evaluation** if significant changes
- Confirm new duties in writing
- **Review salary** - if duties significantly reduced, may affect pay (seek HR advice)
- Set review date (e.g., 6-12 months)

**⚠️ Important:** Permanent job redesign is complex. Always seek HR advice.

---

### 5. Redeployment to Alternative Work

**What it is:**
- Moving employee to a different role
- May be in different team, location, or service
- Can be temporary or permanent

**When to use:**
- Employee **unable to do current role** even with adjustments
- Current duties will make condition worse
- OH says alternative work needed
- Employee cannot return to current role

**When is it reasonable?**
- ✅ When there's a suitable vacancy available
- ✅ When employee has transferable skills
- ✅ When retraining is feasible
- ⚠️ Not reasonable if no suitable vacancies exist

**How to implement:**
- **Get OH advice** on suitable alternative roles
- Discuss with employee: what skills do they have? What can they do?
- Search for vacancies across Council (use Redeployment Register)
- Seek HR advice on redeployment process
- May involve:
  - Trial period in new role
  - Retraining
  - Salary protection (if lower grade)
  - Relocation

**See also:** [Redeployment Guidance and Information](link)

**⚠️ Important:** You must **actively search** for redeployment options. You can't dismiss for capability without exploring redeployment first.

---

### 6. Additional Training / Retraining

- Allow time for learning
- Support employee during learning period
- Review progress

---

### 7. Workplace Adjustments / Equipment

**What it is:**
- Physical changes to workspace
- Specialist equipment
- Assistive technology

**When to use:**
- OH workstation assessment recommends changes
- Employee has physical disability
- Employee reports discomfort/pain at work

- Train employee on use
- Review effectiveness after 3 months

**💰 Funding:** Some equipment may be funded by **Access to Work** (government scheme for disabled employees). Contact Access to Work: 0800 121 7479.

---

### 8. Other Adjustments

**Additional adjustments to consider:**

- **Rest breaks:** More frequent or longer breaks
- **Quiet workspace:** Reduce sensory overload (autism, anxiety)
- **Buddy/mentor:** Support during return or adjustment period
- **Supervision changes:** Different line manager if conflict/stress
- **Communication methods:** Written instructions instead of verbal (learning disability)
- **Exam arrangements:** Extra time for dyslexic employee doing qualification
- **Parking:** Reserved space near entrance (mobility issues)
- **Uniform:** Adapt uniform for disability (e.g., trousers instead of skirt for prosthetic)
- **Working from home:** Avoid office environment triggers
- **Shift patterns:** Avoid night shifts (if condition worsens at night)

**Think creatively!** Adjustments don't have to be expensive or complicated. Often simple changes make a big difference.

---

## How to Implement Adjustments

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Discuss with Employee**
- ✅ Meet with employee to understand their needs
- ✅ Ask: "What would help you do your job?"
- ✅ Listen to their suggestions (they know their condition best)
- ✅ Explain you want to support them

**2. Get Medical Advice**
- ✅ Refer to Occupational Health (if not already done)
- ✅ Ask OH specific questions about adjustments
- ✅ Get GP input (via fit note or letter from employee)
- ✅ Consider Access to Work assessment

**3. Assess Feasibility**
- ✅ Is it operationally possible?
- ✅ What's the cost?
- ✅ Impact on team/service?
- ✅ Is it "reasonable"? (see below)

**4. Consult with Others (If Needed)**
- ✅ Team members (if they'll be affected)
- ✅ HR (for complex cases)
- ✅ Health & Safety (if safety implications)
- ✅ Union rep (if employee requests)

**5. Agree and Implement**
- ✅ Agree specific adjustments with employee
- ✅ Set start date
- ✅ Arrange resources/equipment
- ✅ Inform those who need to know (maintain confidentiality)
- ✅ **Confirm in writing** - state what, when, review date

**6. Review Regularly**
- ✅ Set review date (e.g., 3 months for temporary, 12 months for permanent)
- ✅ Meet with employee to check: is it working?
- ✅ Adjust if needed
- ✅ Continue, extend, or end adjustment as appropriate

---

## Temporary vs Permanent Adjustments

### Temporary Adjustments

**When to use:**
- Short-term health condition (expected to improve)
- Recovery period after surgery/illness
- Trial period to see if adjustment helps

**Typical duration:**
- **Phased return:** Up to 4 weeks
- **Lighter duties after injury:** 3-6 months
- **Reduced hours during treatment:** Duration of treatment + recovery

**Key points:**
- ✅ Set **clear review date**
- ✅ Confirm **timescale** in writing
- ✅ Regular check-ins (weekly/monthly)
- ✅ Plan for **return to full duties**

**Example:**
> "We've agreed that you'll work reduced hours (20hrs/week) for the next 3 months while you undergo chemotherapy. We'll review this arrangement monthly and aim for you to return to full hours once treatment is complete and you feel able. I'll check in with you every 2 weeks to see how you're managing."

---

### Permanent Adjustments

**When to use:**
- Long-term disability or health condition
- Condition unlikely to improve
- OH says adjustment needed indefinitely

**Typical examples:**
- Flexible working for chronic condition (diabetes, arthritis)
- Specialist equipment (screen reader for blind employee)
- Job redesign (removing duties permanently)
- Working from home (mobility issues)

**Key points:**
- ✅ Confirm as **permanent** in writing
- ✅ Still review **annually** (needs may change)
- ✅ May affect **job description** or **salary** (seek HR advice)
- ✅ Consider formal **flexible working request** if hours change

**Example:**
> "We've agreed as a permanent reasonable adjustment that you'll work 9:30am-3:30pm Monday-Friday (28hrs/week) to accommodate your fibromyalgia. Your salary has been adjusted to reflect the reduced hours. We'll review this arrangement annually to check it's still meeting your needs. If your condition changes, please let me know so we can reassess."

---

## What is "Reasonable"?

### The Reasonableness Test

Not every adjustment requested is "reasonable." Consider:

| Factor | Questions to Ask |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Effectiveness** | Will it actually help the employee?<br>Does OH recommend it? |
| **Practicality** | Can we actually do this?<br>Do we have the space, resources, technology? |
| **Cost** | What's the financial cost?<br>Can we afford it?<br>Is funding available (Access to Work)? |
| **Disruption** | How much will it disrupt service delivery?<br>Impact on colleagues and service users? |
| **Health & Safety** | Is it safe for the employee and others?<br>Does it create new risks? |
| **Size of organization** | Glasgow City Council is large - we have more resources than a small business |
| **Availability of resources** | Do we have suitable alternative roles?<br>Is equipment available? |

---

### What IS Usually Reasonable

✅ **Low-cost adjustments:**
- Flexible hours, working from home
- Rest breaks, phased return
- Adjusting workload or duties
- Equipment under £500-£1000

✅ **Adjustments OH recommends:**
- Medical professionals say it's necessary

✅ **Adjustments that prevent absence:**
- Will reduce sickness and save costs

✅ **Adjustments available via Access to Work:**
- Government funding available

✅ **Adjustments that don't compromise service:**
- Service can still be delivered safely and effectively

---

### What Might NOT Be Reasonable

❌ **Very expensive adjustments** (unless Access to Work will fund):
- Major building works (£10,000s)
- Very specialist equipment (unless essential)

❌ **Adjustments that compromise safety:**
- Removing essential safety-critical tasks
- Creating risk to service users or colleagues

❌ **Adjustments that fundamentally change the role:**
- If employee can't do the core purpose of the job even with adjustments

❌ **Adjustments not medically necessary:**
- Employee requests working from home but no medical reason

❌ **Adjustments not available:**
- Redeployment when no suitable vacancies exist

**⚠️ But be careful:** Even if an adjustment seems unreasonable at first, you **must**:
1. Consider it seriously
2. Explore alternatives
3. Seek HR advice before refusing
4. Document your reasoning

**Refusing a reasonable adjustment = discrimination claim.**

## Equality Act 2010 - Your Duties

### Your Legal Duties as a Manager

**If an employee is disabled:**

✅ **MUST** make reasonable adjustments
✅ **MUST** consider adjustments proactively (don't wait to be asked)
✅ **MUST** explore all options
✅ **MUST** implement adjustments if reasonable

**Failure to do so = discrimination.**

---

### What is Disability Discrimination?

**Direct discrimination:**
- Treating disabled person less favorably because of their disability

**Indirect discrimination:**
- Policy or practice that disadvantages disabled people

**Discrimination arising from disability:**
- Treating someone unfavorably because of something connected to their disability
- **Example:** Dismissing someone for poor attendance when absences are disability-related

**Failure to make reasonable adjustments:**
- Not making changes that would help disabled employee

**Harassment:**
- Unwanted conduct related to disability that creates hostile environment

**Victimization:**
- Treating someone badly because they've complained about discrimination

---

### Disability-Related Absence

**⚠️ Critical:** If employee's absence is **disability-related**, you cannot:

❌ Include it in trigger points (without very careful consideration)
❌ Take disciplinary action for it
❌ Dismiss them for it (without exploring all adjustments first)

**You must:**
✅ Explore what adjustments would reduce absence
✅ Refer to OH for advice
✅ Consider disability leave (if policy allows)
✅ Monitor non-disability absence separately

**See also:** [Manager's Guide: Disability and Mental Health](./MANAGERS_DISABILITY_MH_GUIDE.md)

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Back Pain - Equipment Needed

**Situation:**
Employee (admin worker) reports back pain from sitting at desk. OH workstation assessment recommends ergonomic chair (£600) and sit-stand desk (£400).

**Questions to consider:**
- Is the equipment medically necessary? **Yes** (OH recommends it)
- Can we afford it? **Yes** (total £1,000 is reasonable)
- Will it help? **Yes** (likely to reduce pain and absence)
- Is it reasonable? **Yes**

**Action:**
- ✅ Order equipment promptly (within 2 weeks)
- ✅ Arrange installation and setup
- ✅ Show employee how to use (especially sit-stand desk)
- ✅ Review after 3 months - has pain improved?

**Example outcome:** *"We've ordered the ergonomic chair and sit-stand desk recommended by OH. They should arrive within 2 weeks. Once installed, please use the sit-stand desk to alternate between sitting and standing throughout the day. We'll review how you're getting on in 3 months."*

---

### Scenario 2: Anxiety - Flexible Hours Request

**Situation:**
Employee with anxiety disorder requests 10am-4pm hours (instead of 9am-5pm) to avoid rush hour commuting, which triggers panic attacks. Role is care assistant - requires coverage throughout day.

**Questions to consider:**
- Is anxiety a disability? **Possibly** (depends on severity and duration - get OH advice)
- Will 10-4 help? **Yes** (avoids known trigger)
- Can we provide coverage? **Need to assess** (do we have enough staff 9-10am and 4-5pm?)
- Is it reasonable? **Probably yes** (if rota can accommodate)

**Action:**
- ✅ Refer to OH to confirm anxiety meets disability definition
- ✅ Check rota coverage 9-10am and 4-5pm
- ✅ If coverage allows, agree to 10-4 hours
- ✅ If coverage tight, explore alternatives (e.g., 9:30-4:30, or 10-4 some days, 9-5 others)
- ✅ Trial for 3 months, then review
- ✅ Adjust pay if hours reduced

**Example outcome:** *"Based on OH advice, we've agreed you can work 10am-4pm Monday-Friday as a reasonable adjustment for your anxiety. This is a 30hr week (instead of 35hr), so your salary will be adjusted accordingly. We'll trial this for 3 months and review whether it's helping manage your symptoms."*

---

### Scenario 3: Diabetes - Regular Breaks Needed

**Situation:**
Employee with Type 1 diabetes needs to test blood sugar and eat snacks every 2-3 hours. Role is care worker with busy shifts - breaks not always possible.

**Questions to consider:**
- Is diabetes a disability? **Yes** (long-term condition with substantial impact)
- Are breaks medically necessary? **Yes** (essential for diabetes management)
- Can we provide breaks? **Must find a way** (legal duty)
- Is it reasonable? **Yes** (safety critical)

**Action:**
- ✅ Agree employee can take **5-minute breaks every 2-3 hours** to test blood sugar and eat
- ✅ Arrange coverage during breaks (buddy system or overlap shifts)
- ✅ Allow employee to keep testing kit and snacks accessible
- ✅ Educate team on diabetes (with employee's consent) so they can support
- ✅ Write into care plans that employee needs regular breaks
- ✅ No discipline for taking breaks

**Example outcome:** *"As a reasonable adjustment for your diabetes, you can take 5-minute breaks every 2-3 hours to test blood sugar and eat. We've arranged for colleagues to provide cover during these breaks. Please keep your testing kit and snacks in the staff room where you can access them quickly. We've explained to the team why you need these breaks."*

---

### Scenario 4: Mental Health Crisis - Phased Return

**Situation:**
Employee off for 12 weeks with severe depression. OH says fit to return but recommends 4-week phased return. Employee anxious about coping with full workload immediately.

**Questions to consider:**
- Is phased return medically recommended? **Yes** (OH advises it)
- Can we accommodate it? **Should find a way** (standard adjustment)
- Is it reasonable? **Yes** (only 4 weeks, aids recovery)

**Phased return plan:**
- **Week 1:** 2 days (16 hrs) - ease back in
- **Week 2:** 3 days (24 hrs) - build up gradually
- **Week 3:** 4 days (32 hrs) - almost full
- **Week 4:** 5 days (35 hrs) - back to full hours

**Action:**
- ✅ Agree plan with employee **before** return date
- ✅ Adjust rota to show reduced hours weeks 1-3
- ✅ Pay at **full rate** during 4-week phase (seek HR advice on pay)
- ✅ Check in weekly: how are you coping?
- ✅ If struggling, extend by 1-2 weeks (get OH advice)
- ✅ Provide extra support (buddy, regular check-ins)

**Example outcome:** *"We've agreed a 4-week phased return as recommended by OH. You'll work 2 days in week 1, building up to full hours by week 4. You'll be paid at your normal full-time rate during this period. I'll check in with you every Friday to see how you're managing. If you're finding it difficult, let me know and we can adjust the plan."*

---

### Scenario 5: Pregnancy - Remove Manual Handling

**Situation:**
Employee 5 months pregnant, role is care assistant. OH assessment says remove all manual handling immediately. Employee concerned about what duties she can do.

**Questions to consider:**
- Is pregnancy a protected characteristic? **Yes** (pregnancy discrimination law)
- Is manual handling safe? **No** (OH says remove it - H&S duty)
- Can she do alternative duties? **Must find some** (legal duty)
- Is it reasonable? **Yes** (H&S and pregnancy protection)

**Alternative duties:**
- Social activities with residents
- Meal support (serving, assistance with eating)
- Companionship and conversation
- Light housekeeping (tidying, laundry)
- Admin support (care plans, daily notes)
- Training and mentoring new staff

**Action:**
- ✅ **Immediately remove all manual handling** (no lifting, transferring, physical care)
- ✅ Assign alternative duties (see above)
- ✅ Pay at **normal rate** (no reduction for light duties)
- ✅ **Do not include pregnancy-related absence in triggers**
- ✅ Review monthly throughout pregnancy
- ✅ Pregnancy risk assessment

**Example outcome:** *"As recommended by OH and to protect your health and your baby's, we've removed all manual handling duties immediately. You'll focus on social activities, meal support, and companionship with residents. Your pay and hours remain the same. We'll review this monthly as your pregnancy progresses."*

**⚠️ Critical:** Pregnancy discrimination law is very strict. You **must** accommodate pregnant employees. Seek HR advice.

---

### Scenario 6: Can't Implement OH Recommendation

**Situation:**
Employee with severe mobility issues. OH recommends working from home full-time. Role is care assistant in residential home - **cannot** be done from home (direct care delivery required).

**Questions to consider:**
- Is working from home reasonable? **No** (role requires on-site presence)
- What alternatives exist? **Redeployment**
- Have we explored all options? **Must do so**

**Action:**
- ✅ Explain to employee why working from home not possible (role requires direct care)
- ✅ Document specific reasons (operational requirements)
- ✅ **Explore redeployment** - are there admin, phone-based, or office roles available?
- ✅ Refer to Redeployment Register
- ✅ Discuss with employee what roles they could do
- ✅ Active search for suitable vacancies
- ✅ Seek HR advice
- ✅ If no redeployment options, may need to consider ill-health retirement or capability
- ✅ **Only dismiss as last resort after exhausting all options**

**Example outcome:** *"I understand OH has recommended working from home, but unfortunately this isn't possible for a care assistant role which requires direct care delivery on-site. However, I want to explore other options to keep you in employment. I'm going to search for suitable office-based or phone-based roles across the Council that you could do from home or with limited mobility requirements. Let's meet to discuss what roles might suit your skills."*

**⚠️ Important:** You cannot dismiss for capability without exploring redeployment. Seek HR advice.
