## Your Annual Leave Entitlement

### How It's Calculated

Annual leave is now calculated in **hours** rather than days, to accurately reflect our 12-hour shift pattern.

**Why Hours?**
- More accurate for 12-hour shift workers
- Ensures fair allocation across different shift patterns
- Prevents confusion about part days

**Conversion:**
- **35hr staff**: 1 working day = 11.66 hours (based on average shift)
- **24hr staff**: 1 working day = 12 hours (full 12-hour shift)
- **Management/Admin (5-day week)**: 1 day = 7 hours

### Checking Your Balance

**Via the System:**

1. Log in to http://localhost:8000/
2. Click **My Profile** or **Leave Balance**
3. View:
   - Total entitlement (hours & days)
   - Hours used
   - Hours pending (awaiting approval)
   - Hours remaining
   - Carryover hours (if any)

**The system automatically:**
- Deducts approved leave
- Adds back denied requests
- Updates when requests are approved/denied
- Tracks carryover from previous year

## Approval Process

### How Managers Decide

**Automatic Approval:**

The system may auto-approve your request if:
- ✅ Staffing levels remain above minimum threshold
- ✅ Less than 20% of team already off
- ✅ Required skill mix maintained
- ✅ No Working Time Directive conflicts
- ✅ You have sufficient leave balance

**Manual Review Required:**

Manager will review if:
- ⚠️ Staffing will be tight
- ⚠️ Peak period request
- ⚠️ Essential skills coverage needed
- ⚠️ Multiple similar requests pending
- ⚠️ Recent pattern of absence

### Priority Order

When multiple requests compete:

1. **First-come, first-served** (fair allocation)
2. **Compassionate/emergency** leave
3. **Pre-booked holidays** with evidence (flights, hotels)
4. **School holiday requests** (staff with children)
5. **Long service staff** (discretionary)

### Approval Guidelines

**✅ Usually Approved:**
- Planned well in advance
- Adequate cover available
- Reasonable frequency
- Fair to team members
- Within your entitlement

**❌ Usually Denied:**
- Below safe staffing levels
- Too many from same team already off
- Essential skills gap would result
- Submitted too late
- Exceeds your remaining balance

---

## If Your Request Is Denied

### Don't Panic - Here's What to Do

**1. Check the Reason**
- System shows explanation
- Manager should have contacted you
- Usually relates to staffing, not personal

**2. Discuss with Manager**
- Arrange a conversation
- Understand the specific concern
- Be flexible and solution-focused

**3. Alternative Options**
- **Different dates**: Ask when would work better
- **Shorter period**: Split your leave
- **Shift swaps**: Arrange with colleagues
- **Unpaid leave**: Last resort, needs approval

**4. Escalation**
- If you believe decision is unfair
- Speak to senior manager
- Follow grievance procedure if needed
- Be prepared to justify your position

**Remember:** Managers aren't denying you personally - they have legal obligations to maintain safe staffing levels.

**Example:** Start on 1st July (6 months remaining)
- Full entitlement: 297.5 hours
- Pro-rated: 297.5 ÷ 12 × 6 = **148.75 hours**

**System automatically calculates this for you.**

### Leavers

**Final Year Calculation:**

Leave accrues monthly up to your leaving date.

**Example:** Leave on 30th June (6 months worked)
- Full entitlement: 297.5 hours
- Accrued: 297.5 ÷ 12 × 6 = **148.75 hours**
- Already used: 100 hours
- Owed to you: **48.75 hours** (paid in final salary)

## FAQ - Annual Leave

### Q: Can I take all my leave in one go?

**A:** Technically yes, but practically unlikely to be approved. We need continuity of care. Maximum recommended: 2-3 weeks consecutively. Long holidays require very early notice and manager approval.

### Q: Can I take unpaid leave if I've used all my annual leave?

**A:** Unpaid leave is discretionary and requires senior management approval. Usually only for exceptional circumstances (e.g., extended family emergency). Not a right.

### Q: How does the carryover system work?

**A:** You can carry forward a maximum of **5 days** of unused leave into the next year, but:
- Manager approval is required
- Carried over leave **must be used by 31st January** of the following year
- Any unused carryover after January 31st is forfeited
- Carryover is for exceptional circumstances only (e.g., operational needs prevented you taking leave)
- Plan your leave properly to avoid needing carryover

**Example:** If you have 10 hours unused on 31st December 2025:
- Maximum 5 days can carry to 2026
- Must use these by 31st January 2026
- If unused by February 1st, they're lost

### Q: What if I'm sick while on annual leave?

**A:** Contact your manager immediately. If you have a GP certificate:
- Sick leave replaces annual leave
- Hours credited back to your leave balance
- Follow normal sickness reporting procedures

### Q: Can I cash in unused annual leave?

**A:** No. Leave must be taken for your wellbeing. Only exception: payment in lieu upon leaving the organization.

### Q: My request has been pending for over a week. What do I do?

**A:** Contact your line manager. They may not have seen the notification. Occasionally system issues occur - always follow up verbally if urgent.

### Q: Can I book leave during my probation period?

**A:** Yes, but:
- Book early and discuss with manager first
- May be restricted during first 3 months
- Already-booked holidays before you started usually honored
- Don't take excessive leave during probation

### Q: What if my religion requires leave that isn't a Scottish bank holiday?

**A:** Request annual leave for religious observance. Managers will be flexible and supportive. Plan ahead and communicate your needs early.

### Q: Can I take leave at short notice if shifts haven't been published yet?

**A:** Shift publication doesn't affect leave notice periods. Still minimum 14 days notice required. Don't assume "no rota = can book leave easily."
