## Sickness Reporting & Policy

### What do I do if I'm sick and can't come to work?

**STEP 1: Report Your Absence (Same Day)**

**Before Your Shift Starts:**
- **Call your manager directly** - Do NOT text or email only
- **Call at least 2 hours before your shift** (earlier for opening shifts)

**What to Tell Your Manager:**

- When symptoms started
- Expected return date (if known)
- Contact number where you can be reached

**Manager Contact Numbers:**

| **Ongoing** | New fit notes required when previous one expires |

### Where do I submit my fit note?

The system automatically flags:
- **3 or more absences** in a 3-month period

- **Patterns** (e.g., frequent Monday/Friday absences)

**What This Means:**

### Leave Approval Guidelines

**Before Approving Leave:**

1. **Check Staffing Levels**
   - System shows projected coverage
   - Minimum safe levels must be maintained
   - 20% maximum team absence rule

2. **Consider:**
   - First-come, first-served (fair allocation)
   - Essential skills coverage (senior staff)
   - Pending leave requests from others
   - Resident care needs (high dependency periods)

3. **Deny Requests When:**
   - Below minimum staffing threshold

   - Critical skills gap would result
   - Peak demand period (pre-Care Inspectorate inspection, Christmas)

**Communication:**
- Always explain reasons for denial
- Offer alternative dates
- Be consistent and fair

### Investigating Absence Patterns

**System Alerts for:**
- Bradford Factor score >200 (frequent short absences)
- 3+ absences in 3 months
- Monday/Friday pattern detected
- Post-night shift absences

**Investigation Process:**

1. **Review Data**
   - Print absence report from system
   - Look for patterns (dates, day of week, post-events)
   - Check return-to-work interview notes

2. **Informal Meeting**
   - Discuss concerns compassionately
   - Ask about underlying issues
   - Offer support (OH referral, EAP, adjustments)

3. **Support Plan**
   - Set review targets
   - Agree support measures
   - Document everything
   - Follow up regularly

4. **Formal Process (if no improvement)**
   - Consult HR before proceeding
   - Follow HSCP Supporting Attendance Policy
   - Trade union representative may attend
   - Potential outcomes: warnings, redeployment, dismissal (rare)

**Remember:** Most absence is genuine illness - approach with empathy

### Emergency Procedures

**Staff Member Doesn't Show Up (No Call):**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Try calling/texting the staff member (3 attempts)
   - Check if they're on annual leave/forgotten shift
   - Arrange emergency cover from bank/agency
   - Log as "absent without leave" in system

2. **When Contact Made:**
   - Establish reason (genuine emergency vs. no-show)
   - Follow appropriate procedure (sickness vs. disciplinary)

3. **No Contact After 24 Hours:**
   - Escalate to senior management
   - Consider welfare check (especially if out of character)
   - HR involvement required

**Critical Staffing Shortfall:**

If unable to meet minimum safe staffing:
1. Call emergency bank staff immediately
