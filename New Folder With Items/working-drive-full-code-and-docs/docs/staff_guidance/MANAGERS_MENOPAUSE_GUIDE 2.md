**Why this matters:**

- ✅ **70% of Council workforce** are female - high likelihood you'll manage someone experiencing menopause
- ✅ **Average age 51** - most women experience menopause during working life
- ✅ **75% experience symptoms** - 25% have severe symptoms
- ✅ **Career impact** - symptoms can affect confidence, attendance, and performance
- ✅ **Retention risk** - lack of support causes women to leave jobs or reduce hours

> **💡 Key principle:** Create an environment where employees feel comfortable discussing menopause and asking for support. Small adjustments can make a big difference.

I'd also suggest speaking to your GP about treatment options, and PAM Assist can provide counseling support if you need someone to talk to. Let's meet again in 2 weeks to see how you're getting on."*

**Situation:**
You've noticed employee (admin officer, age 52) is making more mistakes than usual, seems forgetful, and has become tearful on two occasions. You're concerned about her wellbeing and work quality.

   - Don't assume

I'd also suggest speaking to your GP about treatment options. Let's review in a month to see if these adjustments are helping."*

I'm going to refer you to Occupational Health for expert advice on adjustments, and I'd also encourage you to speak to your GP about treatment options like HRT which can really help. In the meantime, let's try flexible working hours and temperature control to see if that makes a difference."*

### Scenario 5: Team Member Makes Insensitive Comments
