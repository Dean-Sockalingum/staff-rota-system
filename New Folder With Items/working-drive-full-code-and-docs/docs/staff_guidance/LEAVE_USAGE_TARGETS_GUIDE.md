# Annual Leave Usage Targets Guide

**For Managers: Preventing Year-End Leave Build-up**

---

## Quick Summary

To prevent staff from accumulating excessive leave and causing year-end disruption, managers should monitor leave usage against the **40-week target**:

- **Target**: Staff should use approximately **1 day of leave per week** over 40 working weeks
- **Simplified**: **4-5 days per month** consistently throughout the year
- **Result**: All annual leave used evenly, preventing rushes and ensuring adequate rest

---

## The 40-Week Strategy

### Why 40 Weeks?

- **52 weeks** in a year
- Minus **~8 weeks** for bank holidays, unit closures, training days
- Minus **~4 weeks** buffer for flexibility
- = **40 active working weeks** for planned leave usage

### Target by Entitlement Level

| Entitlement | Days/Week Target | Days/Month Target |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 40 days (full-time) | ~1.0 day | ~4.3 days |
| 35 days (part-time) | ~0.9 day | ~3.8 days |
| 30 days (reduced) | ~0.8 day | ~3.3 days |
| 45 days (enhanced) | ~1.1 days | ~4.9 days |

## Manager Conversation Templates

### Green Status
> "Hi [Name], just checking in on leave. I can see you're taking regular breaks throughout the year which is great. Keep it up!"

### Amber Status  
> "Hi [Name], I've noticed you're a bit behind on using your annual leave. You have [X] days remaining with [Y] months left. Have you got any leave planned? Let me know if you need help arranging coverage."

### Red Status
> "Hi [Name], I need to discuss your annual leave urgently. You have [X] days remaining with only [Y] months left - you're significantly behind target. I need you to book at least [Z] days in the next month and provide a plan for the rest. Taking leave is mandatory for your wellbeing."

**Response**: Explain 40-week strategy, set interim quarterly targets
