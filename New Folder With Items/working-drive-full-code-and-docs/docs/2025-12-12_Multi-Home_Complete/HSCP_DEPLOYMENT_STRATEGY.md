**Date:** January 8, 2026  
**Topic:** Domain Strategy & Marketing Approach for Public Sector Healthcare

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE RECOMMENDATION

**For HSCP (Health & Social Care Partnerships):**

### ❌ DO NOT Host on Your Own Domain
### ✅ OFFER On-Premise/Self-Hosted Deployment

**Why?** Public sector healthcare in Scotland has specific requirements that make traditional SaaS problematic.

---

## 📊 DEPLOYMENT MODEL COMPARISON

### Option 1: SaaS (Your Domain) ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED

**Example:** `staffrota.yourdomain.com`

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easier for you to maintain
- ✅ Faster deployment
- ✅ Lower initial IT requirements

**Cons (Critical for HSCP):**
- ❌ **Data sovereignty issues** - Patient/staff data leaving their control
- ❌ **Procurement barriers** - Requires extensive security audits
- ❌ **Cyber Essentials Plus** - You need certification (£5-10k/year)
- ❌ **ISO 27001** - Required for NHS/HSCP data (£20-40k initial + £10k/year)
- ❌ **Scottish Government frameworks** - Must be on approved supplier list
- ❌ **GDPR compliance burden** - You become data processor
- ❌ **Insurance requirements** - Professional indemnity, cyber insurance
- ❌ **Long procurement cycles** - 6-12 months for new SaaS vendors
- ❌ **Trust issues** - "Who is this small vendor? Can they be trusted?"

### Option 2: On-Premise/Self-Hosted ✅ RECOMMENDED

**Example:** `staffrota.glasgowhscp.scot` (their domain, their servers)

**Pros (Critical for HSCP):**
- ✅ **Data stays on HSCP servers** - No sovereignty issues
- ✅ **Fast procurement** - Software purchase, not service contract
- ✅ **Lower security barrier** - They manage security, not you
- ✅ **No ongoing compliance costs for you** - They handle it
- ✅ **Integration friendly** - Can connect to their existing systems
- ✅ **Customization possible** - Open source, they can modify
- ✅ **One-time fee model** - No monthly subscriptions (public sector prefers CapEx)
- ✅ **Ownership** - They own the system, not dependent on you

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ They need IT resources (but HSCPs already have this)
- ⚠️ You provide implementation support, not hosting

### Option 3: Hybrid (Managed Self-Hosted) ✅ ALSO GOOD

**Example:** You set up on their infrastructure, they maintain

**Model:**
- Initial deployment: You install on their servers
- Training: You train their team
- Support contract: Optional annual support (10-20% of license fee)
- Updates: They manage, you provide new versions

## 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 SCOTTISH PUBLIC SECTOR PROCUREMENT REALITIES

### What HSCP Buyers Care About:

1. **Data Sovereignty** 🔴 CRITICAL
   - Data MUST stay in Scotland/UK
   - NHS Scotland has strict rules
   - Even AWS UK regions are questioned

2. **Security Certifications** 🔴 CRITICAL
   - Cyber Essentials Plus (minimum)
   - ISO 27001 (preferred)
   - PSN (Public Services Network) if connecting to NHS

3. **Procurement Framework** 🟠 HIGH
   - Scottish Government Digital Marketplace
   - NHS National Services Scotland frameworks
   - Local frameworks (Glasgow City Council)

4. **Cost Model** 🟠 HIGH
   - CapEx preferred over OpEx (one-time purchase vs subscription)
   - "Cost per user per month" triggers long approvals
   - "One-time license + optional support" = faster approval

5. **Vendor Stability** 🟡 MEDIUM
   - Public sector worries about vendor going bust
   - Open source = safety net (they can maintain it)
   - Your system being open source is a HUGE advantage
