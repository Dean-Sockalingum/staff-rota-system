## Slide 2: The Problem

### Before Automation: Manager Burden + Executive Blind Spots

**Daily Coverage Management**: 3+ hours per manager
**Financial Planning**: Reactive, no predictive intelligence
**Retention Crisis**: No early warning system
**Compliance Risk**: Manual tracking, no CI performance prediction

```

```

**Manager Burden**: 3.75 hours for 2 vacancies  
**Executive Gap**: No real-time KPIs, no predictive analytics

# Presentation Notes

## Delivery Tips

1. **Opening** (Slide 1-2): Start with the pain → "How many hours do your managers spend on coverage management?"

2. **Demo** (Slide 4): Live demo is critical. If fails, have backup video ready.

3. **Results** (Slides 5-8): Lead with time savings (most relatable), then money, then compliance.

4. **Financials** (Slide 9): Emphasize ROI percentage (2,252%) and payback (15 days) → This is extraordinary.

5. **Phase 2** (Slide 11-12): Sell the vision, not just Phase 1. "This is just the beginning."

6. **Close** (Slide 15): Clear ask → "Approve Phase 2 funding today."

---

## Q&A Preparation

**Q: How long until Phase 2?**  
A: 3 months. We can start January 2026 if approved today.

**Q: What if staff don't use it?**  
A: 96% active user rate in first 3 weeks. Staff love instant feedback.

**Q: Can we customize rules?**  
A: Absolutely. All thresholds configurable (£200 limit, escalation timer, qualification scores).

**Q: What about other homes?**  
A: System is multi-tenant ready. Can onboard 10 homes in parallel (3 days each).

**Q: CGI's role?**
