## ⚠️ Common User Errors

### "I can't find a staff member"
**Troubleshooting Steps:**
```
✓ Check spelling of name
✓ Try searching by staff ID instead
✓ Check "Show Inactive" filter (staff may be on long-term leave)
✓ Verify you're searching correct home
✓ Ask AI: "Where is [staff name]?"
```

### "AI Assistant not responding"
**Quick Fixes:**
```
1. Check your question is clear and specific
2. Try rephrasing: "Show me" instead of "Can you show me"
3. Avoid complex multi-part questions
4. Refresh page if stuck for >10 seconds
5. Fall back to manual navigation
```

**Good Questions:**
- ✅ "Who can cover night shift at Riverside tonight?"
- ✅ "Show overtime for Sarah Johnson this week"
- ✅ "List all compliance violations"

**Bad Questions:**
- ❌ "Can you maybe possibly show me if there's anyone who might be available?"
- ❌ Questions with multiple requests in one

### "Overtime offer sent but staff says not received"
**Check:**
```
1. Overtime → Sent Offers → Find the offer
2. Verify: Status, Send time, Staff contact details
3. Check staff profile has correct email/phone
4. Resend: Click "Resend Notification"
5. Follow up with manual call
```

### "Can't approve leave request"
**Common Causes:**
```
Reason 1: Insufficient permissions
→ Check your role: Only OM/SM can approve
→ Request approval from Service Manager

Reason 2: Would create staffing gap
→ System shows impact warning
→ Arrange cover first, then approve
→ Or override with justification note

Reason 3: Staff has insufficient balance
→ Check leave balance on staff profile
→ Discuss with staff if balance incorrect
```

```

---

## 👤 Staff Management Issues

### "Can't add new staff member"
**Check These:**
```
✓ All required fields filled (marked with *)
✓ Staff ID is unique (not already used)
✓ Email format is valid
✓ Start date is today or future
✓ At least one role selected
✓ Home/Unit assigned
```

**Error Messages:**
- "Staff ID exists" → Choose different ID
- "Invalid email" → Check format: name@domain.com
- "Required field" → Red highlighted fields must be filled

### "Staff appears multiple times"
**Solution:**
```
1. Check: Are these actually duplicates or different roles?
2. Verify: Staff ID is different = separate records
3. If duplicate: Contact admin to merge records
4. Prevention: Always search before creating new staff
```

---

## 📅 Scheduling Problems

### "Can't create shift - validation error"
**Common Issues:**
```
Issue: "Overlapping shift exists"
→ Check if staff already assigned another shift that time
→ Either remove old shift or change times

Issue: "Insufficient staffing"
→ Add more staff to shift
→ Or reduce minimum requirements

Issue: "Budget exceeded"
→ Get SM approval
→ Or use different staff (lower cost)
```

### "Shift won't save"
**Troubleshooting:**
```
1. Check all required fields filled
2. Verify start time is before end time
3. Ensure date is not in past (unless backdating allowed)
4. Check staff selected are active
5. Save timeout: Try reducing number of changes at once
```

---

## 💰 Budget & Overtime Issues

### "Overtime calculation seems wrong"
**Verify:**
```
1. Check staff base rate: Staff Profile → Contract Details
2. Verify overtime multiplier (usually 1.5x)
3. Check if shift is public holiday (different rate)
4. Ensure all shift hours logged correctly
5. Ask AI: "Calculate overtime for [staff] [date]"
```

### "Budget warning but I'm under budget"
**Possible Causes:**
```
- Warning is forecast (including pending requests)
- Different time period being compared
- Cache showing old data (refresh)
- Budget may be weekly/monthly vs your calculation
```

---

## 🔔 Notification Issues

### "Not receiving email notifications"
**Check:**
```
1. Profile → Settings → Email Notifications (enabled?)
2. Check spam/junk folder
3. Verify email address correct in profile
4. Test: Settings → Send Test Email
5. If still issues: Contact IT to check email server
```

### "Too many notifications"
**Customize:**
```
Profile → Notification Preferences
Turn off:
- Low priority alerts
- Digest mode (daily summary instead of each one)
- Specific event types you don't need
```

---

## 🔐 Permission Issues

### "Access Denied" or "You don't have permission"
**Understanding Permissions:**
```
Role-Based Access:
- Staff: View own shifts only
- Team Lead: View team data
- OM: Manage units, approve overtime
- SM: Cross-home access, budget approval
- Admin: Full system access

Fix:
1. Check your role: Profile → Account Type
2. Contact SM if you need elevated access
3. Emergency access: SM can grant temporary permissions
```

---

## 📱 Mobile App Issues

### "App won't sync"
**Quick Fixes:**
```
1. Check internet connection
2. Close and reopen app
3. Pull down to refresh
4. Check storage space (need 100MB free)
5. Update to latest version
6. Reinstall app if persistent
```

### "App slower than website"
**Optimization:**
```
- Clear app cache: Settings → Clear Cache
- Close other apps
- Reduce date range in filters
- Use desktop for complex tasks
- Check mobile data signal strength
```

## 🤖 AI Assistant Specific Issues

### "AI gives wrong information"
**What to Do:**
```
1. Verify data independently (check source)
2. Report: Click "Feedback" button
3. Rephrase question more specifically
4. Check you're asking about correct date/home
5. Document issue for IT team
```

### "AI says 'I don't understand'"
**Improve Your Query:**
```
Be specific:
❌ "Show me stuff"
✅ "Show me night shifts this week"

Use correct terminology:
❌ "Workers"
✅ "Staff" or "Care Workers"

One question at a time:
❌ "Show me shifts and overtime and who's on leave"
✅ "Show me today's shifts" (then ask next question)
```

```
