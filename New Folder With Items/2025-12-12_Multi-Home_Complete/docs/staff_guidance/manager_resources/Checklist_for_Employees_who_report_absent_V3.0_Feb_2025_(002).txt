Introduction  
You should use this checklist  as a guide to the types of questions you may wish to ask when an 
employee telephones you to report absent. Asking these types of questions allows you to obtain full 
details from the employee as to : 
• the natu re and reason for their absence;  
• how lo ng they expect to be absent for;  and  
• any issues you need to be aware of while they’ re off.   
 
It also enables you to:  
• assess whether you can offer the employee any help and support; and  
• make arrangements to cover their duties in their absence.  
 
You can find more information in the process that an employee should follow when reporting 
absent in  supporting attendance: manager's guide .
