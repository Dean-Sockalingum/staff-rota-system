The organisation is committed to:

---

## 2️⃣ Standards of Attendance

### What You Need to Know

The organisation sets attendance targets at Council and Service levels. These are **NOT individual targets** you must achieve, but:

- You should strive for the highest attendance level possible
- If your attendance regularly falls below targets, it may indicate unsustainable absence levels

✅ **Engage fully** with the policy process  
✅ **Attend occupational health referrals** when arranged

## 4️⃣ Health Issues at Work (Without Absence)

### When You're at Work But Not 100%

If you develop a health problem that affects your work **but you haven't been absent**:

1. **Tell your manager** as early as possible
2. Your manager will consider how to **support you** to maintain attendance
3. This policy's principles apply to these situations too

---

## 5️⃣ How to Report Sickness Absence

- **Local arrangements** may apply for non-standard working patterns

### What Your Manager Will Ask

When you call, expect a supportive discussion covering:

✓ What is the reason for your absence?  
✓ How long do you expect to be off?  
✓ Have you sought medical advice?  
✓ Is there anything we can do to help?  
✓ Are there any workplace issues contributing to your absence?

## 7️⃣ Attendance Reviews – When They Happen

### Review Thresholds

An **Attendance Review** will be arranged if you have:

| **Threshold Type** | **What Triggers Review** |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Certified Absences** | 3 absences in 6 months OR 5 absences in 12 months |
| **Working Days Lost** | 6 working days in 6 months OR 8 working days in 12 months |
| **Unauthorised Absence** | Any period of unauthorised absence |

> **Note**: Certified absence criteria is **not** applied pro-rata. Working days criteria **is** applied pro-rata for part-time staff.

### What to Expect

✅ Review arranged **promptly** after the triggering absence  
✅ You may be **accompanied** by a colleague or union representative  
✅ Meeting will be **recorded** using appropriate paperwork  
✅ Decisions will be **current and relevant** to your situation

---

## 8️⃣ Support Available to You

### Management Will Consider

Throughout the attendance process, your manager will consider appropriate support:

- 🧠 **Mental health and wellbeing** arrangements
- 💬 **Employee Assistance Provider (EAP)** – PAM Assist
- 🏥 **Occupational Health referral**
- ⚖️ **Work-life balance** arrangements
- 🍺 **Alcohol and drugs support** policy
- 🛡️ **Bullying and harassment** policy
- ♿ **Disability support** guide
- 🏢 **Health and safety** policy

> **This list is not exhaustive** – speak to your manager about what might help.

---

## 9️⃣ Wellbeing Support Meeting

### What Is This?

A **Wellbeing Support Meeting** provides early assistance when you're absent due to:
- **Psychological conditions** (stress, anxiety, depression)
- **Musculoskeletal conditions** (back pain, joint problems)

### When It Happens

- **Within 2 weeks** of your first day of absence
- Usually **face-to-face** or via Microsoft Teams
- Your manager will identify support to aid your recovery

### For Stress-Related Absence

If you report stress, your manager will conduct a **stress risk assessment** with you to identify appropriate supports.

---

## 🔟 Employee Assistance Provider (EAP)

### PAM Assist Services

The organisation provides **free, confidential counseling and information services** through PAM Assist.

### When to Use EAP

✓ **Psychological conditions** – stress, anxiety, depression  
✓ **Long-term absence anxiety** – worries about health, returning to work, finances  
✓ **Workplace bullying/harassment** – dedicated helpline available  
✓ **Any personal issues** affecting your wellbeing

### How It Works

1. **Self-referral** – contact PAM Assist directly (details from HR/manager)
2. **Confidential service** – they won't tell your employer unless you consent
3. **Progress reports** – if you consent, your manager can receive updates
4. **Follow-up meeting** – discuss report content with your manager

> **Manager's Role**: Your manager will remind you about EAP services during absences related to psychological conditions or long-term illness.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Occupational Health (OH)

### What Occupational Health Does

The **Occupational Health Provider** gives independent medical advice to management about:

✓ Impact of your health condition on your ability to do your job  
✓ Likelihood of full recovery and timeframe  
✓ Timescale for return to work  
✓ Duties you may be capable of performing  
✓ Whether Equality Act 2010 applies (disability)  
✓ Reasonable adjustments to support your return/attendance

### Important to Understand

- **OH provides advice** to management – they don't diagnose or treat
- **Your GP/NHS** is responsible for diagnosis and treatment
- **Management makes decisions** – not Occupational Health
- **You'll receive a copy** of the OH report from your manager
- **Discuss the report** with your manager after receiving it

### Musculoskeletal Referrals

For **untreated musculoskeletal conditions** (back pain, joint issues):

1. OH will **triage** your referral
2. May include **telephone and/or face-to-face consultation**
3. You may receive **exercise advice** to improve your condition
4. Some cases may involve **physical manipulation/physiotherapy**

> **Note**: Most musculoskeletal referrals involve telephone advice from a physiotherapist, not always hands-on treatment.

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Phased Return to Work

### What Is a Phased Return?

Returning after **long-term absence** can be physically and mentally challenging. A **phased return** allows you to gradually build back to full duties.

### Key Details

| **Aspect** | **Details** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Duration** | Up to 4 weeks |
| **Pay** | Fully paid |
| **Who Can Recommend** | Management, Occupational Health, you, or your GP |

### What Your Manager Considers

Before approving a phased return:

✓ Operational needs of the service  
✓ Nature of your role  
✓ Your current state of health  
✓ Length of your absence  
✓ Advice from Occupational Health and your GP  
✓ Your engagement with the attendance process

### How It Works

- **Gradual build-up** of working days/hours
- **Regular monitoring** throughout the period
- **Progress discussions** with your manager before resuming full duties

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Workplace Accidents and Industrial Injury

### Separate Allowance

If you're absent due to a **workplace accident or industrial disease**:

✅ You get a **separate sickness allowance**  
✅ Calculated the **same as normal sickness allowance**  
✅ **Doesn't count** against your normal sickness entitlement  
✅ Two allowances are **entirely separate**

### Requirements for Workplace Accident Absence

To qualify for payment:

1. **Accident book entry** (BI/510) must be completed
2. **Investigation** by the Council confirms facts are accurate
3. **No negligence** on your part (you followed safe working methods)

### Attendance Management

- Managers must **carefully evaluate** reasons for absence
- **Industrial injuries** taken into account when reviewing attendance
- If you **regularly sustain injuries**, additional training may be required
- Health & Safety Officers available to assist

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Types of Sickness Absence

### Two Categories

| **Category** | **Definition** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Short-Term Intermittent** | Any absence up to and including **19 working days** |
| **Long-Term Absence** | Any single absence of **20 or more working days** |

> **Note**: Pro-rated for non-standard working patterns

### Equality Act 2010 and Disability

Managers must be mindful of the **Equality Act 2010** when managing absence. You're considered **disabled** if you have:

- A **physical or mental impairment**
- That has a **substantial and long-term adverse effect**
- On your ability to **carry out normal day-to-day activities**

#### What This Means

- **Impairment**: Physical or mental (or both)
- **Long-term**: Lasting at least a year, or likely to last for life, or recur
- **Substantial**: More than minor (may fluctuate or change)
- **Day-to-day activities**: Things you do in your own time and at work

> **Complex Cases**: Managing disability-related absence can be complex. Your manager will consult with Strategic HR for guidance.

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ Managing Short-Term Intermittent Absence

### The Process

**Step 1**: Short-term absence managed via **Attendance Review** (Section 7)

**Step 2**: If you regularly meet review thresholds, management will use **support facilities** (Section 8)

**Step 3**: If support doesn't result in acceptable attendance, your record will be reviewed as a **capability issue** (Section 19)

---

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Managing Long-Term Absence

### Regular Meetings

If you're on long-term absence:

- Manager meets with you **every 4-6 weeks** throughout absence
- Frequency depends on your circumstances, health, treatment plan, and prognosis

### Why Regular Meetings Matter

🔹 Maintain **relationship** between you and your manager  
🔹 You can **update** on your health and thoughts about returning  
🔹 Manager can **update** you on workplace situations  
🔹 Discuss any **management decisions** relating to your absence

### Where Meetings Happen

**Typical locations**:
- Your usual workplace
- Alternative Council premises
- Via Microsoft Teams
- Mutually agreed alternative location (in some circumstances)

> **Privacy**: Location must allow private discussion about health and workplace matters.

### Support During Long-Term Absence

Manager will use facilities from Sections 8-12 as appropriate:
- EAP referral
- Occupational Health consultation
- Wellbeing support
- Phased return planning

### When You Return

✅ **Return to work discussion** (Section 6)  
✅ **Attendance review** arranged (Section 7)

### Extended Absence (13+ weeks)

If absent **over 13 weeks**, your annual leave entitlement will be **recalculated** according to Conditions of Service.

### If You Can't Return

If unable to return due to ill health, **capability considerations** (Section 19) will be initiated.

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Combination of Absence Types

### Mixed Absence Records

Your record may include both short and long-term absences.

**How it's managed**:
- Each individual absence managed according to its category (Sections 15 & 16)
- Manager reviews your **overall attendance record**
- If overall record is **unacceptable**, capability consideration (Section 19) initiated

---

## 1️⃣8️⃣ Terminal Illness

### Compassionate Management

Employees diagnosed with **terminal illness** will be managed in a **dignified and compassionate manner**.

### Dying to Work Charter

The organisation has adopted the **TUC Dying to Work Charter**:

> **We will not dismiss** any person with a terminal diagnosis because of their condition, unless in the employee's best interests.

### Support Available

If you or a colleague faces this situation, your line manager should contact **Service Strategic HR** for specialized support and guidance.

---

## 1️⃣9️⃣ Capability Considerations

### When This Applies

If a **return to work** or **acceptable attendance level** cannot be achieved, capability considerations may begin.

### What Might Lead to This

- Regular spells of **short-term intermittent absence**
- **Long-term absence** (single spell or multiple spells)
- **Combination** of short and long-term absences
- **Specific patterns** of absences

### No Single Threshold

> **Important**: There's no fixed threshold for capability considerations. Every situation is unique based on your health, duration/spells of absence, and capacity to work.

### The Process

**Step 1**: Formal notification that:
- There's concern about your attendance
- Your continued employment is at risk

**Step 2**: Explore all options to support improved attendance:

✓ Additional training/retraining  
✓ Occupational Health advice  
✓ Reasonable time off for rehabilitation/treatment  
✓ Alternative or restricted duties  
✓ Flexible/part-time working  
✓ Phased return to work  
✓ Redeployment opportunities  
✓ Redesign of duties

> **This list is not exhaustive** – all reasonable options will be considered.

**Step 3**: If options aren't viable and acceptable attendance can't be achieved:
- Management **may consider** termination on grounds of capability
- If you're in the **Local Government Pension Scheme**, eligibility for ill-health retirement assessed first

### Before Any Dismissal Decision

Management must fully address:

✅ Full consideration of why employment cannot be sustained?  
✅ Have you been fully consulted about your health and ability to attend regularly?  
✅ Has **up-to-date medical advice** been obtained and considered?  
✅ Taking into account your **length of service**, has enough support been provided?

> **Critical**: Managers **must consult** with Service Strategic HR before any dismissal decision.

### Your Right to Appeal

You have the **right to appeal** against dismissal on capability grounds under the **Discipline & Appeals Procedure**.

---

## 2️⃣0️⃣ Disciplinary Considerations

### When Disciplinary Action May Apply

Disciplinary action may be considered if there are **breaches of conduct** at any stage:

⚠️ **Unauthorised absence**  
⚠️ **Failure to comply** with absence reporting procedures  
⚠️ **Abuse of sick pay provisions**  
⚠️ **Fraudulent conduct**

### Process

Handled according to the Council's **Discipline and Appeals Procedure**.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Will I be disciplined for being sick?**  
A: No. Genuine sickness is not a disciplinary matter. This is a **capability policy**, not disciplinary. However, breaches of the reporting process or fraudulent sick leave claims are disciplinary matters.

**Q: Can I be dismissed for sickness absence?**  
A: Only as a last resort after all reasonable support options have been exhausted, and only on **capability grounds** (not misconduct). You would have the right to appeal.

**Q: Will I lose my sick pay?**  
A: No, your sickness allowance entitlements are protected under your Conditions of Service. This policy aims to **protect these provisions** through fair management.

**Q: Can I bring someone to an Attendance Review?**  
A: Yes. You may be accompanied by a **colleague or trade union representative** to any formal meeting.

### Reporting Questions

**Q: Can I text or email instead of calling?**  
A: No. **Phone calls are required** on days 1, 4, 7, and every 7 days thereafter.

**Q: What if my manager isn't available when I call?**  
A: Follow your local arrangements (leave message, call deputy, etc.). Your manager will call you back.

**Q: Do I need a sick note from day 1?**  
A: Not usually. Self-certification applies initially. Your manager will advise if a GP fit note is required (typically for absences over 7 days).

### Support Questions

**Q: Will Occupational Health tell my manager everything?**  
A: OH provides **management advice**, not detailed medical history. They focus on your **fitness for work** and what adjustments might help.

**Q: Is EAP really confidential?**  
A: Yes. PAM Assist won't share information without your **explicit consent**. You can use the service without your employer knowing.

**Q: Can I refuse an OH referral?**  
A: You can, but it's not in your best interests. OH referrals help management understand how to support you. Refusing may limit the options available.

### Return to Work Questions

**Q: Can I return part-time after long-term absence?**  
A: Possibly. **Phased returns** (up to 4 weeks, fully paid) are available. Longer-term part-time work would need to be considered based on operational needs.

**Q: What if I feel I'm being forced back too early?**  
A: Speak to your manager, your GP, and consider an OH referral. You should only return when **fit to do so**.

**Q: Do I have to attend a return to work discussion?**  
A: Yes, it's part of the policy. It's informal, supportive, and ensures you're fit to work.

### Disability Questions

**Q: I have a long-term health condition. Am I protected?**  
A: Possibly. If your condition meets the **Equality Act 2010 definition of disability**, you have additional protections and rights to reasonable adjustments.

**Q: What are reasonable adjustments?**  
A: Changes to your work, workplace, or working arrangements that help you do your job despite your disability. Examples: altered duties, flexible hours, equipment, redeployment.

**Q: How do I know if the Equality Act applies to me?**  
A: Speak to your manager or Strategic HR. An OH referral can help assess this.
