## Key Policy Elements Extracted

### Policy Framework

#### 1. **Aims and Objectives**
- Support high levels of attendance
- Minimize detrimental effects of sickness absence
- Manage attendance fairly, legally, and consistently
- Provide early assistance to employees with health problems

#### 2. **Standards of Attendance**
- Council/Service attendance targets set
- Targets are NOT individual requirements
- Falling regularly below targets = indication of unsustainable absence

#### 3. **Responsibilities**
- Employees must fully engage with policy
- Attend OH referrals, management discussions
- Follow agreed return to work plans
- Protects comprehensive sickness allowance provisions

### Reporting and Return to Work

#### 4. **Absence Reporting Requirements**
- **Phone call required** on days 1, 4, 7, and every 7th day thereafter
- Contact calculated on calendar days
- Local arrangements for non-standard patterns
- Manager discussion covers 8 key questions

#### 5. **Return to Work Discussion**
- Takes place on first day back (or ASAP)
- Informal, supportive meeting
- Covers reason, fitness, support needed
- Self-certificate form completed
- Avoid delays in arranging

#### 6. **Attendance Review Thresholds**
- **3 certified absences in 6 months** OR **5 in 12 months**

- Work-life balance arrangements
- Alcohol and drugs support
- Bullying and harassment policy
- Disability guide

#### 8. **Wellbeing Support Meeting**
- For psychological or musculoskeletal conditions
- Within 2 weeks of first day of absence
- Face-to-face or MS Teams
- Stress risk assessment for stress-related absence

#### 9. **Employee Assistance Provider (PAM Assist)**
- Free confidential counseling and information
- Mandatory reminder for psychological conditions
- Can use during long-term absence anxiety
- Dedicated Bullying & Harassment helpline
- Progress reports with employee consent

#### 10. **Occupational Health**
- Contracted OHP provides independent management advice
- NOT for diagnosis/treatment (that's NHS/GP)
- Assesses fitness for work, recovery timeframe, adjustments
- Considers Equality Act 2010 (disability)
- Reports discussed with employee
- Musculoskeletal referrals triaged (may include physio)

#### 11. **Phased Return to Work**
- Up to 4 weeks, fully paid
- For return from long-term absence
- Can be recommended by management, OH, employee, or GP
- Considers operational needs, role nature, health, absence length
- Gradual build of working days
- Progress monitored and discussed

### Absence Categories

#### 12. **Workplace Accidents/Industrial Injury**
- Separate allowance (doesn't count against normal sickness)
- Requires accident book entry (BI/510)
- Investigation confirms accuracy and no negligence
- Industrial injuries considered when assessing attendance
- Regular injuries = additional training needed

#### 13. **Short-Term vs Long-Term Absence**
- **Short-term**: Up to 19 working days (pro-rata)
- **Long-term**: 20+ working days (pro-rata)
- Equality Act 2010 considerations for disability
- Disability = substantial, long-term adverse effect on day-to-day activities

#### 14. **Managing Short-Term Intermittent Absence**
- Via Attendance Review process
- Regular threshold meetings = support interventions
- If support doesn't work = capability consideration

#### 15. **Managing Long-Term Absence**
- Meetings every 4-6 weeks throughout absence
- Maintain manager-employee relationship
- Update on health, workplace, decisions
- Meetings at workplace, alternative premises, or MS Teams
- After 13 weeks: leave entitlement recalculated
- If can't return = capability consideration

#### 16. **Combination Absences**
- Mix of short and long-term managed separately
- Overall record reviewed
- If unacceptable = capability consideration

#### 17. **Terminal Illness**
- Dignified and compassionate management
- Dying to Work Charter adopted
- Will not dismiss due to terminal diagnosis (unless in employee's best interests)
- Contact Service Strategic HR

### Capability and Discipline

#### 18. **Capability Considerations**
- When return/acceptable attendance can't be achieved
- May result in contract termination (last resort)
- Triggers: regular short-term, long-term, combination, specific patterns
- **No single threshold** - unique to circumstances
- Employee formally advised employment at risk
- All options explored: training, OH advice, time off for treatment, alternative duties, flexible working, phased return, redeployment, redesign

#### 19. **Before Dismissal**
Must address:
- Full consideration of why employment can't be sustained
- Full consultation about health and attendance ability
- Up-to-date medical advice obtained
- Enough support given considering length of service
- Ill-health retirement eligibility assessed (if pension scheme member)
- **Must consult Service Strategic HR**

#### 20. **Right to Appeal**
- Appeal against dismissal via Discipline & Appeals Procedure

#### 21. **Disciplinary Considerations**
May apply for conduct breaches:
