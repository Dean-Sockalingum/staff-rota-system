# Manager's Guide: Supporting Employees with Disabilities and Mental Health Conditions

## Introduction

This guide explains your **responsibilities** and **best practices** for supporting employees who have:
- **Disabilities** (physical or mental)
- **Mental health problems** (anxiety, depression, etc.)
- **Stress** (work-related or personal)

**Why this matters:**

- ✅ **Legal duty** under Equality Act 2010 (for disabled employees)
- ✅ **Duty of care** to all employees' health and wellbeing
- ✅ **Business benefit** - supporting employees reduces absence and retains skills
- ✅ **1 in 4** people experience mental health problems at some point
- ✅ **Get it wrong** = potential discrimination claims, dismissals, increased absence

> **💡 Key principle:** Treat employees as individuals, provide appropriate support, make reasonable adjustments, and seek expert advice when needed.

## Part 1: Disability

### What is Disability?

**Equality Act 2010 Definition:**

A disability is:

> "A **physical or mental impairment** which has a **substantial** and **long-term adverse effect** on the ability to carry out **normal day-to-day activities**."

Let's break this down:

---

#### 1. Physical or Mental Impairment

This refers to conditions such as:

**Physical conditions:**
- Chronic pain conditions
- Diabetes
- Epilepsy
- Asthma
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Visual impairments (blind, partially sighted)
- Hearing impairments (deaf, hard of hearing)
- Mobility impairments (wheelchair users, difficulty walking)
- Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME)

**Mental health conditions:**
- Depression
- Anxiety disorders
- Bipolar disorder
- Schizophrenia
- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)

**Learning disabilities and neurodiversity:**
- Autism spectrum disorder (including Asperger's)
- Down's syndrome
- Dyslexia
- Dyspraxia
- ADHD

**Progressive conditions:**

Conditions that are likely to change and develop over time are **classed as a disability from diagnosis**:
- Cancer
- Multiple sclerosis (MS)
- Muscular dystrophy
- HIV infection
- Motor neurone disease

---

#### 2. Substantial and Long-Term Adverse Effect

**Substantial** means:
- Significant, not minor or trivial
- More than a small impact on daily life

**Long-term** means the impairment:
- Has lasted **at least 12 months**; OR
- Is likely to last **at least 12 months**; OR
- Is likely to last for the **rest of the person's life**

**Adverse effect** means:
- Unfavorable impact
- Makes things difficult or impossible

---

#### 3. Normal Day-to-Day Activities

There's no specific definition, but includes things like:

- Using a telephone
- Reading a book
- Using public transport
- Walking up stairs
- Concentrating
- Remembering
- Communicating

**Examples of substantial adverse effects:**
- ❌ Unable to hear and understand another person speaking clearly over the telephone
- ❌ Unable to speak clearly enough to give basic instructions
- ❌ Difficulty going up or down steps
- ❌ Bowel or bladder problems
- ❌ Persistently unable to remember names of familiar people (e.g., work colleagues)
- ❌ Severe pain that prevents normal movement

---

### Is This Employee Disabled?

**How to decide:**

1. **Ask the employee** - Have they been diagnosed with a condition?
2. **Refer to Occupational Health** - Get expert medical opinion
3. **Consider Equality Act definition** - Does it meet all 3 parts?
4. **Seek HR advice** - If unsure

**⚠️ Important:**
- Don't make assumptions
- Some disabilities are **hidden** (chronic pain, mental health, autism)
- Employee may not consider themselves "disabled"
- **You don't need a formal diagnosis** - focus on functional impact

**If in doubt, treat as if disabled and make adjustments anyway** - safer legally.

---

### Reasonable Adjustments

**What are reasonable adjustments?**

Changes to working arrangements or the work environment that help a disabled employee to:
- Do their job
- Avoid being disadvantaged compared to non-disabled colleagues

**Three types under Equality Act 2010:**

1. **Changing the way things are done**
   - E.g., Adjusting working hours, allowing home working, changing duties

2. **Making changes to physical environment**
   - E.g., Providing ramps, adjusting desks/chairs, better lighting

3. **Providing aids and services**
   - E.g., Special computer software, hearing loop, sign language interpreter

---

### Examples of Reasonable Adjustments

| Adjustment Type | Examples |
|----------------|----------|
| **Hours/attendance** | Flexible start/finish times<br>Part-time working<br>Frequent breaks<br>Time off for medical appointments |
| **Duties** | Giving some duties to another employee<br>Removing physically demanding tasks<br>Adjusting workload |
| **Equipment** | Voice-activated computer software (visual impairment)<br>Ergonomic chair and desk<br>Amplified telephone (hearing loss)<br>Screen reader software<br>Special keyboard/mouse |
| **Physical environment** | Ramp for wheelchair<br>Moving workstation (light switches, shelves)<br>Ground floor office<br>Reserved parking space |
| **Support** | Mentoring or buddy<br>Training or retraining<br>Additional supervision<br>Reader or interpreter |
| **Work location** | Transfer to different workplace<br>Home working<br>Office nearer to facilities |
| **Communication** | Written instructions (instead of verbal)<br>Altering reference materials<br>Extra time for tasks |

**See full list:** [Manager's Guide: Reasonable Adjustments](./MANAGERS_REASONABLE_ADJUSTMENTS_GUIDE.md)

---

### Disability and Absence

**⚠️ Critical:** It's **not reasonable to assume** that a disabled employee will be off sick more than a non-disabled employee.

**If a disabled employee is absent:**

1. ✅ **Find out if absence is disability-related**
   - Ask the employee
   - Get OH advice

2. ✅ **Consider reasonable adjustments** to reduce absence
   - Equipment
   - Flexible hours
   - Adjusted duties
   - Stress reduction

3. ✅ **Do NOT include disability-related absence in trigger points** (without very careful consideration and HR advice)

4. ✅ **Monitor non-disability absence separately**

**Example:**
Employee with diabetes has 5 absences in 6 months (trigger threshold breached):
- 3 absences: diabetes-related (hospital appointments, hypos)
- 2 absences: flu and cold (unrelated)

**Action:**
- **Don't count** the 3 diabetes absences in triggers
- **Do count** the 2 unrelated absences
- **Do** consider adjustments (time off for appointments, flexible hours to manage blood sugar)
- **Do** refer to OH for advice on adjustments

**⚠️ Dismissing for disability-related absence = discrimination** (unless you can justify it was unavoidable even with all reasonable adjustments).

---

### Role of Occupational Health and Reasonable Adjustments

**When to refer to OH:**
- Employee discloses disability
- You suspect disability
- Need advice on adjustments
- Assessing if employee meets disability definition

**What to ask OH:**

1. Does the employee have a disability under the Equality Act 2010?
2. What tasks can the employee do?
3. What tasks can't they do, and why?
4. What reasonable adjustments would help?
5. Is the employee fit for their current role with adjustments?
6. If not, what alternative roles might be suitable?

**See:** [Manager's Guide: OH Referrals](./MANAGERS_OH_REFERRAL_GUIDE.md)

---

### When You Receive the OH Report

**Steps to take:**

1. ✅ **Read the report carefully**
2. ✅ **Discuss with the employee**
   - What does the report mean?
   - Do they agree with recommendations?
   - What adjustments would help them?
3. ✅ **Decide if employee is disabled**
   - Based on OH advice + employee information
   - Seek HR advice if unsure
4. ✅ **Assess reasonable adjustments**
   - How practical is it?
   - How effective will it be?
   - Financial cost?
   - Disruption to service?
   - Effect on service delivery?
   - Other resources available (Access to Work)?
5. ✅ **Implement adjustments**
   - Act promptly
   - Confirm in writing
   - Set review date

**⚠️ If OH recommends an adjustment and it's reasonable, you MUST implement it** - failure to do so = discrimination.

---

### Access to Work

**What is Access to Work?**

Government grant-funded program that provides **practical support and financial assistance** for disabled employees.

**What can Access to Work pay for?**

- ✅ Special aids or equipment
- ✅ Changes to existing equipment
- ✅ Changes to premises or work environment
- ✅ Cost of travel to work (if can't use public transport)
- ✅ Support worker (practical help at work or getting to work)
- ✅ Specialist coaching

- Contact: **0800 121 7479**
- Website: www.gov.uk/access-to-work

**See:** [Access to Work - Manager's Guide](link)

---

### Termination of Employment

**Only consider this as absolute last resort.**

**Before dismissal, you MUST have:**

1. ✅ Explored **ill-health retirement** (if employee is pension fund member)
2. ✅ Explored **ALL reasonable adjustments**
3. ✅ Explored **redeployment** to alternative roles
4. ✅ Obtained **OH medical opinion**
5. ✅ Sought **HR advice**
6. ✅ Documented **everything**

---

#### Ill-Health Retirement

**For Strathclyde Pension Fund members:**

OH assesses if employee:
- **Tier 1:** Unlikely to work again before age 65; OR
- **Tier 2:** Reasonable prospect of working again before 65

**For Teachers:**
- Application to Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA)

**See:** [Supporting Attendance Managers Guide](./MANAGERS_ATTENDANCE_GUIDE.md) for full process

---

#### Dismissal on Capability Grounds

**Only in cases where:**

- ❌ Employee doesn't meet ill-health retirement criteria
- ❌ All reasonable adjustments explored and exhausted
- ❌ No suitable redeployment options
- ❌ Employee unable to do the job or any other duties

**You MUST be able to justify the decision:**
- Evidence all adjustments considered
- Evidence all redeployment explored
- Medical evidence supporting decision
- Full audit trail

**⚠️ High legal risk - always seek HR advice.**

---

---

### Mental Health Problems and Absence

**Key principles:**

1. ✅ **Treat the same as any other employee** (unless they need specific support)
2. ✅ **Don't make assumptions** about what they can/can't do
3. ✅ **Don't assume frequent absence** because of condition
4. ✅ **Work with them** to provide support based on their individual needs
5. ✅ **Be flexible** while maintaining fairness

**Most people with mental health problems continue to work successfully with appropriate support.**

---

### Managing Mental Health Absence

#### Early Intervention Meeting

**When to hold:**
- **Within first 7 days** of mental health-related absence starting (where appropriate)
- May need to delay if employee very unwell

**Purpose:**
- Understand the situation
- Offer support
- Plan contact and return

**See:** [Supporting Attendance Managers Guide](./MANAGERS_ATTENDANCE_GUIDE.md)

---

#### Maintaining Contact

**Be sensitive** - mental health absence may be different from physical illness.

**Consider:**
- How is contact maintained?
- Is employee well enough to speak to you directly?
- Would they prefer contact via:
  - Family member?
  - Trade union rep?
  - Other appropriate person?
- How often is contact appropriate?
- Phone, email, or letter?

**Example:**
*"I understand you're unwell and may not feel up to speaking. I'd like to check in weekly just to see how you're doing and if there's any support you need. Would you prefer I call you, email, or contact you through someone else?"*

---

#### Monitoring the Situation

**If employee returns to work but continues treatment:**

1. ✅ **Support them** through treatment period
2. ✅ **Put in place monitoring and supervision** (sensitively)
3. ✅ **Regular check-ins** - how are they coping?
4. ✅ **Review if illness impacts duties** - seek OH advice
5. ✅ **Understand effect of medication** - OH can advise

**Examples of support:**
- Regular 1:1 meetings (weekly at first, then fortnightly)
- Reduced workload initially
- Flexible hours for therapy appointments
- Quiet workspace
- Adjusted duties temporarily

**⚠️ Managing mental health is complex - seek HR advice if unsure.**

---

## Part 3: Stress

### What is Stress?

**Health and Safety Executive (HSE) definition:**

> "The **adverse reaction** people have to **excessive pressures** or other types of demand placed on them."

**Key points:**

- ✅ **Pressure can be positive** and motivating
- ❌ **Stress occurs** when pressure becomes too much
- ⚠️ **Stress is NOT a disability** under Equality Act
- ⚠️ **BUT:** Employee may develop disability (e.g., depression) as result of stress

---

**See:** [Supporting Attendance Managers Guide](./MANAGERS_ATTENDANCE_GUIDE.md)

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Employee Discloses Autism

**Situation:**
Employee (admin worker) discloses they are autistic. They've been struggling with open-plan office (noise, sensory overload) and find team meetings stressful. Performance is good but they're anxious.

**Is this a disability?**  
**Yes** - autism is a protected disability under Equality Act.

**Reasonable adjustments to consider:**
- Quiet workspace away from main office
- Noise-cancelling headphones
- Written agendas for meetings (advance notice)
- Allow them to leave meetings if overwhelmed
- Clear, written instructions (not just verbal)
- Regular 1:1s (instead of group discussions)
- Predictable routine (minimize sudden changes)

**Action:**
1. ✅ Thank them for sharing
2. ✅ Ask: "What would help you at work?"
3. ✅ Refer to OH for advice on adjustments
4. ✅ Implement adjustments promptly
5. ✅ Review regularly

**Example outcome:**  
*"Thank you for telling me. I want to make sure you have what you need to do your job well. Let's arrange for you to work in the quiet room to reduce sensory overload, and I'll make sure you get written agendas for meetings at least 24 hours in advance. I've also referred you to OH to see if there are any other adjustments that would help. We'll review this in 3 months to make sure it's working for you."*

---

### Scenario 2: Depression - Frequent Short Absences

**Situation:**
Employee has had 6 absences in 8 months (all 1-3 days), all related to depression. They're on medication and seeing therapist. Attendance trigger breached.

**Is this a disability?**  
**Likely yes** - depression can be substantial and long-term. Get OH advice.

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Don't discipline for absence if disability-related
- ❌ Don't include disability absence in trigger count
- ❌ Don't dismiss without exploring all adjustments

**What to do:**
1. ✅ Refer to OH - confirm disability status and ask about adjustments
2. ✅ Monitor **non-disability** absence separately
3. ✅ Explore adjustments:
   - Flexible hours for therapy appointments
   - Mental health days (small number per year)
   - Reduced hours temporarily
   - Wellbeing check-ins
4. ✅ Offer EAP if not already accessing
5. ✅ Reasonable expectations during treatment period

**Example outcome:**  
*"I understand your absences are related to your depression and you're receiving treatment. I've referred you to OH to get advice on what support would help. In the meantime, I'm not going to count your depression-related absences towards the trigger threshold, but I do need to monitor your overall fitness for work. I'd like to have weekly check-ins to see how you're doing and what support you need. We also have confidential counseling through PAM Assist if that would help."*

---

### Scenario 3: Work-Related Stress - Heavy Workload

**Situation:**
Employee (care assistant) reports feeling overwhelmed and stressed. They're tearful at work, struggling to sleep, and have asked for help. Cause: staff shortages mean they're covering extra shifts, working overtime, dealing with complex residents.

**Is this a disability?**  
**No** (stress itself isn't), but could develop into depression if not addressed.

**Action:**
1. ✅ **Act immediately** - don't wait for absence
2. ✅ **Meet with employee** (confidential, supportive)
3. ✅ **Identify specific stressors:**
   - Working too many hours?
   - Too many complex cases?
   - Lack of support?
   - Poor work-life balance?
4. ✅ **Take action to reduce stress:**
   - Reduce overtime (enforce rest periods)
   - Redistribute complex cases
   - Provide additional supervision/support
   - Bring in extra staff/agency cover
5. ✅ **Stress risk assessment** (H&S requirement)
6. ✅ **Offer EAP** (0800 247 1100)
7. ✅ **Monitor closely** - regular check-ins

**Example outcome:**  
*"I can see you're really struggling and I'm sorry you've been under so much pressure. I'm going to make some immediate changes: no more overtime for the next month, and I'm bringing in agency cover to reduce the workload. I'm also reassigning some of your most complex residents to spread the load. Let's have weekly check-ins to make sure things improve. I'd also suggest speaking to PAM Assist for some support in managing stress - they're available 24/7 on 0800 247 1100."*

---

### Scenario 4: Diabetes - Frequent Hypos at Work

**Situation:**
Employee with Type 1 diabetes experiencing frequent hypoglycemic episodes (low blood sugar) at work. They need to test blood sugar and eat every 2-3 hours. Colleagues complaining they're "always on breaks."

**Is this a disability?**  
**Yes** - diabetes is a long-term condition with substantial impact.

**Reasonable adjustments:**
1. ✅ **Allow regular breaks** (5 mins every 2-3 hours to test and eat) - **non-negotiable**
2. ✅ **Allow snacks at workstation** (keep blood sugar stable)
3. ✅ **No discipline for breaks** (medically necessary)
4. ✅ **Educate team** (with employee's consent) - explain diabetes and why breaks needed
5. ✅ **Emergency protocol** - what to do if severe hypo

**Address colleague complaints:**
- Explain (without breaching confidentiality) that breaks are a reasonable adjustment
- It's not favoritism - it's legal requirement
- Ask for understanding and support

**Example outcome:**  
*"Your diabetes is a disability under the Equality Act, which means we have a legal duty to make reasonable adjustments. You need regular breaks to test blood sugar and eat - this is not optional, it's medically essential. I'm putting this in writing and explaining to the team that these breaks are a medical necessity. Please don't feel you have to justify taking them. If anyone has concerns, ask them to speak to me."*

---

### Scenario 5: Anxiety - Employee Refuses OH Referral

**Situation:**
Employee has anxiety and panic attacks. Attendance poor. You want to refer to OH to explore adjustments, but employee refuses - worried OH will say they can't do the job.

**Why they might refuse:**
- Fear of being dismissed
- Stigma about mental health
- Don't understand OH's role
- Bad previous experience
- Worried about confidentiality

**How to respond:**

1. ✅ **Reassure them:**
   - OH is **supportive**, not punitive
   - OH's job is to **help**, not get them dismissed
   - Confidential - OH won't share diagnosis, just functional advice
   - Independent medical opinion
   - You need expert advice to **support** them properly

2. ✅ **Explain what happens:**
   - Appointment with OH clinician (nurse or doctor)
   - They'll ask about impact on work
   - Report will suggest adjustments
   - You'll discuss report with them

3. ✅ **Explain consequences of refusal:**
   - You need medical advice to make informed decisions
   - Without OH input, harder to support them effectively
   - May be contractual requirement in some cases

4. ✅ **Give them control:**
   - They can suggest what questions you ask OH
   - They'll see OH report before you implement anything
   - They can comment on accuracy

**Example conversation:**  
*"I understand you're worried about the OH referral, but I want to reassure you - OH's job is to help us support you, not to find reasons to dismiss you. They'll assess what adjustments might help you manage your anxiety at work. The report won't include your diagnosis or personal details - just advice on what would help. I can't make the best decisions to support you without expert medical advice. Can we discuss what you're worried about?"*
