## 📧 INITIAL OUTREACH EMAIL

**Subject:** Free Staff Scheduling System Pilot - Glasgow Care Homes

---

Dear [Care Home Manager Name],

I'm reaching out to care home operators in Glasgow to offer a limited **FREE pilot program** for an AI-powered staff scheduling system.

**What We're Offering:**
✓ Full system implementation (normally £10,000 value) - **FREE**  
✓ 3 months unlimited support  
✓ On-site training for your team  
✓ Data migration from your current system  
✓ Mobile app for staff  

**What We're Looking For:**
In exchange, we'd like to:
- Document your experience as a case study
- Use anonymized data to validate our ML forecasting
- Get a testimonial we can share with other care providers

**Why Now?**
We've built a production-ready system that's already managing 109,000+ shifts for care homes. Before scaling to larger HSCP contracts, we want to validate our implementation process with 2-3 small-to-medium operators like yourself.

**The System Includes:**
- Automated shift scheduling (saves managers 26+ hours/week)
- ML forecasting to predict staffing needs 4 weeks ahead
- Compliance tracking (training, supervision, right-to-work)
- Mobile app for shift swaps and leave requests
- Real-time reports for CQC inspections

**Next Steps:**
If you're interested, I'd love to schedule a 15-minute call to show you a quick demo and see if it's a good fit.

Available times: [Calendly link]

Or reply with your availability.

**[Your Name]**  
**[Your Title]**  
**Email:** [your.email@domain.com]  
**Phone:** [Your number]  
**Demo:** demo.staffrotascotland.co.uk

P.S. No credit card required, no long-term contracts. If you don't like it after 3 months, we part as friends.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this really free?
Yes. No credit card required, no surprise fees, no small print. We want case studies, you get professional implementation.

### What's the catch?
We need:
- Your time for training/feedback
- Permission to write a case study
- A testimonial if successful
- Honest feedback to improve the system

### Can we customize it?
Absolutely. It's open source, so you can modify anything. During the pilot, we'll handle customizations for you.

### What if we have existing shift data?
We can import it from Excel, CSV, or most scheduling systems. Historical data helps ML forecasting learn faster.

Week 1 can begin within 7 days of signing pilot agreement.

### What happens to our data after the pilot?
It's yours. You can export it anytime, keep using the system, or discontinue.
