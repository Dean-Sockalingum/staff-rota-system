Dear Editor,

I am writing to submit our manuscript entitled **"Development and Implementation of a Multi-Tenancy Staff Scheduling System for Healthcare Facilities: A Case Study in Automated Compliance and Workforce Optimisation"** for consideration for publication in *Health Informatics Journal*.

## Significance and Originality

This work presents the first documented open-source, multi-tenancy staff scheduling system specifically designed for UK care home settings, addressing a critical gap in healthcare information systems research. The system demonstrates exceptional operational impact:

- **89% reduction in administrative burden** across 16 staff members (Operational Managers, Service Managers, Information Management staff, Head of Service)
- **£1.09M annual savings** through combined automation (£488,941), machine learning forecasting (£251,250), and linear programming optimization (£346,500)
- **14,897% first-year return on investment** with a 1.8-day payback period
- **Validated deployment** managing 821 staff across 5 care homes (42 units, 109,267 shifts)

Beyond the technical contributions, this work holds particular significance for **Scottish public sector digital transformation**. The system exemplifies all seven core principles of the Scottish Government's Digital Strategy for Scotland 2025-2028, including ethical AI deployment, user-centered design, workforce capability building, and financial sustainability. Our analysis projects a **£26.9 million annual national impact** if adopted across 50% of Scotland's 45 Health and Social Care Partnerships.

## Key Contributions to Health Informatics Literature

1. **Multi-Tenancy Architecture:** Proven row-level data isolation approach scalable to 10+ healthcare facilities with 500-1,000 users, addressing data privacy concerns that prevent shared infrastructure adoption.

2. **Machine Learning Validation Methodology:** Prophet forecasting model achieving 25.1% MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) across diverse care units, with transparent accuracy disclosure and 80% confidence intervals addressing "black box AI" concerns in healthcare.

3. **Linear Programming Formulation:** Cost-optimal shift assignment with 5 constraint types (demand, Working Time Directive compliance, skills matching, equity, availability), delivering 12.6% cost reduction in <30 seconds solve time.

4. **Automated Leave Approval Algorithm:** 70% auto-approval rate using 5 business rules, eliminating 364 manager hours annually while maintaining Care Inspectorate compliance.

5. **Policy Alignment Framework:** Demonstrates practical implementation of Scottish Government digital transformation principles, providing replicable model for other UK health and social care organizations.

6. **Evidence-Based Development Methodology:** Comprehensive iteration history (5 phases, 270 hours, quantified time/cost analysis) documenting pivots, lessons learned, and user acceptance testing (SUS score 76.3, above industry average 68).

## Relevance to *Health Informatics Journal* Readership

This manuscript aligns closely with the journal's scope, particularly:

- **Healthcare IT System Design:** Multi-tenancy architecture addressing real-world scalability and privacy challenges in resource-constrained care settings
- **Clinical Decision Support:** Machine learning forecasting enabling proactive staffing decisions 30 days in advance
- **Implementation Science:** Detailed agile development methodology with user co-design (9 Operational Managers, 3 Service Managers)
- **Evaluation Methods:** Mixed-methods evaluation combining time-motion studies, performance benchmarking, usability testing (System Usability Scale), and cost-benefit analysis
- **Policy and Practice Integration:** Explicit mapping to national digital health strategy, demonstrating academic rigour with practical relevance

The manuscript contributes to ongoing discourse on open-source alternatives to commercial healthcare IT solutions, ethical AI deployment in care settings, and user-centered design methodologies for diverse user populations (frontline staff with varying digital literacy to executive decision-makers).

## UK Public Sector Context and Generalizability

While the system was developed for Glasgow Health and Social Care Partnership's older people's care homes, the architecture and methodology are deliberately designed for reproducibility across UK health and social care settings. The comprehensive documentation (30+ guides), open-source licensing (GPL-3.0), and modular Django implementation enable adaptation to:

- **Other Scottish HSCPs:** 45 partnerships managing similar-scale care home portfolios
- **English Local Authorities:** 152 authorities with social care responsibilities under Care Quality Commission regulation
- **Welsh Health Boards:** 7 boards integrating health and social care
- **Northern Irish Health Trusts:** 5 trusts with residential care oversight

The system's compliance framework is mapped to Care Inspectorate (Scotland) standards but readily adaptable to CQC (England), Care Inspectorate Wales, and RQIA (Northern Ireland) requirements, as all UK regulators share common principles around staffing levels, training compliance, and safeguarding.

## Ethical Approval and Data Governance

- **Ethics:** Operational quality improvement project; formal NHS ethics approval not required per Health Research Authority guidance. All staff data anonymized in manuscript per GDPR Article 89.
- **Data Sharing:** System codebase available on GitHub under GPL-3.0 license. Anonymized dataset (shift patterns, forecast accuracy metrics) available upon request for reproducibility.
- **Conflicts of Interest:** No financial conflicts. System developed in-house with no commercial partnerships or vendor relationships.
- **Patient and Public Involvement:** System co-designed with 9 Operational Managers and 3 Service Managers representing frontline user perspectives. No direct patient involvement (system manages staff, not patient data).

## Why *Health Informatics Journal*?

We have chosen *Health Informatics Journal* as our preferred venue for the following reasons:

1. **International Readership with UK Focus:** Journal's balance of global healthcare IT scholarship with strong UK public sector representation ensures relevance to both academic and practitioner audiences.

2. **Multi-Disciplinary Scope:** Our work spans computer science (multi-tenancy architecture, machine learning), operations research (linear programming), human-computer interaction (usability testing), and health services research (cost-benefit analysis)—aligning perfectly with the journal's interdisciplinary approach.

3. **Implementation Science Emphasis:** Journal's interest in "real-world" healthcare IT deployments rather than laboratory prototypes matches our production-validated system managing 821 users.

4. **Open Access Option:** To maximize impact and support Scottish Government open access mandates for publicly funded research, we intend to select the OnlineOpen option for unrestricted public access.

5. **Policy Relevance:** Journal's track record publishing work with direct policy implications (e.g., NHS Digital Transformation studies) makes it ideal venue for demonstrating Scottish Digital Strategy 2025-2028 principles in practice.
