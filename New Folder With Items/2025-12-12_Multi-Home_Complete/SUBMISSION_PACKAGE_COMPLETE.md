## 💡 Tips for Successful Submission

### Maximize Impact
- **Open Access:** Consider OnlineOpen (£2,290 APC) for unrestricted access - aligns with Scottish Government open research mandate
- **Twitter Thread:** Prepare 5-tweet summary for publication announcement (@GlasgowHSCP, @scotgov, @HIJournal)
- **Press Release:** Coordinate with Glasgow HSCP communications team - £26.9M national impact projection is newsworthy
- **Policy Brief:** Create 2-page summary for Scottish Government Digital Directorate (link research to policy)

### Increase Citation Potential
- **Preprint:** Consider arXiv/medRxiv pre-submission (immediate visibility, altmetrics boost)
- **Code Release:** Well-documented GitHub repo increases reproducibility citations
- **Dataset Sharing:** Anonymized data on Zenodo enables secondary analysis studies
- **Blog Post:** SAGE MethodSpace or personal academic blog explaining methodology

### Address Potential Reviewer Concerns Proactively
1. **"Not generalizable beyond Glasgow"** → Emphasize replicable methodology, Scottish HSCP similarity, UK regulatory alignment
2. **"No randomized controlled trial"** → Position as implementation science, cite SQUIRE guidelines, highlight pragmatic evaluation
3. **"ML accuracy not state-of-art"** → Focus on transparency (disclosed MAPE), user trust, operational improvement vs. benchmark competition
4. **"Commercial bias (promoting open-source)"** → Emphasize no financial gain, public sector context, evidence-based cost comparison
