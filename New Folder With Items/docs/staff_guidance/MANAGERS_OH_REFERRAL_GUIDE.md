## When to Refer to OH

### You SHOULD Refer When:

| Situation | Why OH Referral Needed | Urgency |
|-----------|------------------------|---------|
| **Long-term absence** (28+ days) | Expert medical opinion on prognosis<br>Likely return date<br>Support needed | Within first 4 weeks |
| **Frequent short-term absences** | Investigate underlying condition<br>Explore if work-related<br>Consider adjustments | When trigger breached |
| **Musculoskeletal issues** | Assess for physiotherapy (PHIL)<br>Workstation assessment<br>Adjustments needed | Early referral improves recovery |
| **Stress/mental health** | Not work-related? OH can advise<br>Fitness for work assessment<br>Adjustments or redeployment | After EAP/Able Futures |
| **Capability concerns** | Medical opinion on capability<br>Explore all options before dismissal<br>Ill-health retirement possibility | Before capability procedure |
| **Disability disclosed** | Reasonable adjustments assessment<br>Equality Act compliance<br>Access to Work application | As soon as disclosed |
| **Pregnancy-related absence** | Health and Safety assessment<br>Adjustments during pregnancy<br>Fitness for specific duties | When health concerns arise |
| **Return after surgery/injury** | Phased return plan<br>Temporary adjustments<br>Fitness for full duties | Before return to work |
| **Workplace injury/illness** | Investigate work-related cause<br>Risk assessment needed<br>Prevention measures | Immediately |
| **Display Screen Equipment (DSE) issues** | Workstation assessment<br>Ergonomic equipment needed<br>Prevent long-term injury | When employee reports discomfort |

---

### You MAY Refer When:

- **Pattern of absence** you want medical opinion on
- **Employee requests** OH referral for support
- **Adjustments being considered** and you need expert advice on what's reasonable
- **Redeployment** being explored and you need medical restrictions clarified
- **Disciplinary process** where medical issues may be relevant (get advice first)
- **Conflict** between employee's GP advice and work requirements

---

### You Should NOT Refer When:

❌ **Instead of offering EAP** - Try EAP first for stress/personal issues  
❌ **For short-term minor illness** - E.g., colds, flu (unless pattern)  
❌ **Without employee's knowledge** - Must discuss with employee first  
❌ **To get employee "signed fit"** - OH won't override GP; they give independent advice  
❌ **As punishment** - OH is support, not discipline  
❌ **For performance issues** - Unless health is suspected underlying cause  

> **⚠️ Remember:** OH provides **independent medical advice**. They work for the Council, not you or the employee. Their duty is to give **impartial, professional opinion**.

---

## Before Making a Referral

### 1. Meet with the Employee

**You MUST:**

- ✅ Explain **why** you want to refer them to OH
- ✅ Explain **what** OH will do (medical assessment)
- ✅ Explain **how** information will be used (to support them at work)
- ✅ Discuss **concerns** (theirs and yours)
- ✅ Answer **questions** about the process
- ✅ Obtain **consent** (usually required)
- ✅ Complete **Employee Information Pro forma**

**Employee Information Pro forma should capture:**

- Full name, date of birth, SAP number
- Full postal address and postcode
- Contact telephone numbers (home, mobile)
- Preferred contact method (phone, email, text)
- Job title and duties
- Current absence status (in work, off sick, phased return)
- Reason for referral
- Any dates/times employee unavailable for appointment

---

### 2. Gather Information for Referral

Before logging into OHIO, have ready:

| Information Needed | Where to Find It |
|--------------------|------------------|
| **Employee SAP number** | MyView, employee record |
| **Employee personal details** | From meeting with employee |
| **Attendance record** | MyView absence history |
| **Job description** | Personnel file or team records |
| **Details of absence(s)** | Self-cert forms, fit notes, RTW notes |
| **Support already offered** | Notes from RTW discussions, emails |
| **Specific questions for OH** | What do you need to know? |
| **Dates employee unavailable** | From discussion with employee |
| **Any upcoming deadlines** | E.g., disciplinary hearing, review meeting |

---

### 3. Decide What Type of Referral

| Type | When to Use | What It Is |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Management Referral** | Most common<br>Long-term absence, frequent absence, capability, adjustments | Face-to-face or telephone consultation with OH clinician<br>Written report provided |
| **Workstation/DSE Assessment** | Employee has musculoskeletal issues<br>Back/neck pain, RSI, eye strain<br>DSE user with discomfort | OH physiotherapist assesses workstation<br>Recommends ergonomic adjustments |
| **Physiotherapy (PHIL)** | Musculoskeletal injury or pain<br>Back, neck, shoulder, knee issues<br>Work-related or not | Assessment and treatment by physiotherapist<br>Up to 6 sessions<br>Can refer even if employee at work |

---

### 4. Consider Timing

**Think about:**

- 📅 **Is there an upcoming deadline?** (e.g., attendance review, disciplinary hearing)  
  → Tell OH in the referral so they can prioritize
  
- ⏰ **How urgent is the case?**  
  → Contact OH Advice Line (0141 428 3900) for urgent cases
  
- 🏥 **Is employee seeing their GP soon?**  
  → May be worth waiting for GP input, then refer to OH
  
- 📆 **When is employee available?**  
  → Provide unavailable dates so OH can schedule appropriately

## Understanding OH Reports

### What the Report Contains

An OH report typically includes:

| Section | What It Says |
|---------|-------------|
| **Employee details** | Name, date of birth, job title, date of consultation |
| **Reason for referral** | Your questions/concerns |
| **History** | Summary of employee's medical history relevant to referral |
| **Clinical findings** | What the OH clinician assessed (usually not diagnostic details) |
| **Fitness for work** | Whether employee is fit for current role, with/without adjustments |
| **Likely duration** | If off sick, how long absence may last |
| **Prognosis** | Long-term outlook (will they recover fully?) |
| **Recommendations** | Specific actions you should take (adjustments, phased return, etc.) |
| **Review** | Whether/when further OH review needed |

---

### What OH Reports DON'T Contain

OH reports will **not**:

- ❌ Give you a **diagnosis** (that's confidential between employee and clinician)
- ❌ Tell you **exactly what's wrong** medically
- ❌ Override GP advice or "sign employee fit" against GP's view
- ❌ Make **management decisions** for you (e.g., "dismiss the employee")
- ❌ Tell you to **ignore** employee's rights or policy

**Why?**

- OH provides **independent medical advice** to help **you** make informed **management decisions**
- Medical details are **confidential**
- You need to know **functional impact** on work, not diagnosis

---

### Key Things to Look For

**1. Fitness for Work Statement:**

Examples:
- ✅ "Employee is fit for work with no restrictions"
- ⚠️ "Employee is fit for work with the following adjustments..."
- 🏥 "Employee is currently unfit for work but likely to be fit within 4-6 weeks"
- ❌ "Employee is unlikely to be fit to return to current role"

**2. Recommendations:**

These are **specific actions** OH advises you to take. Examples:
- "Phased return over 4 weeks (50% hours week 1, 75% week 2, full hours week 3)"
- "Provide ergonomic chair with lumbar support"
- "Adjust duties to remove lone working for 3 months"
- "Refer to Access to Work for assessment"
- "Consider redeployment to less physically demanding role"

**3. Duration/Prognosis:**

This helps you **plan**. Examples:
- "Likely to be off work for further 2-3 weeks"
- "Full recovery expected within 6 months"
- "This is a long-term condition which will require ongoing adjustments"
- "Condition is unlikely to improve; capability to fulfill role is doubtful"

**4. Review Recommendation:**

Does OH want to see the employee again? Examples:
- "No further OH review needed at this time"
- "Review in 3 months to assess effectiveness of adjustments"
- "Review before return to work to discuss phased return plan"

---

### If You Don't Understand the Report

**Don't guess.** Contact **OH Advice Line: 0141 428 3900**

Ask for clarification on:
- What a recommendation means in practice
- How to implement an adjustment
- Whether something is reasonable
- What happens if recommendations aren't followed

---

## Acting on OH Recommendations

**OH recommendations are professional medical advice. You should follow them unless there's a good reason not to.**

### Step 1: Read the Report Carefully

- ✅ Read the full report (don't just skim)
- ✅ Identify **specific recommendations**
- ✅ Note any **timescales** (e.g., "review in 3 months")
- ✅ Check if **further review** needed

---

### Step 2: Assess Feasibility

For each recommendation, ask:

| Question | Consider |
|----------|----------|
| **Can we do this?** | Do we have resources, budget, space? |
| **Is it reasonable?** | Equality Act duty - usually yes if recommended by OH |
| **How long for?** | Temporary (weeks) or long-term (permanent)? |
| **Impact on team/service?** | Can we still deliver service? Can we cover duties? |
| **Cost?** | Can we afford it? Is funding available (Access to Work)? |
| **What if we don't?** | What's the risk to employee health? Legal risk? |

---

### Step 3: Implement Recommendations

**For each recommendation:**

1. ✅ **Discuss with employee** - Explain what you're going to do and why
2. ✅ **Agree details** - E.g., specific hours for phased return, which duties to adjust
3. ✅ **Set start date** - When will adjustment begin?
4. ✅ **Confirm in writing** - Send email or letter summarizing agreed adjustments
5. ✅ **Inform others** - Tell team, rota planners, HR (as needed)
6. ✅ **Arrange resources** - Order equipment, arrange cover, adjust duties
7. ✅ **Monitor effectiveness** - Is it working? Check in with employee regularly

---

### Step 4: Review as Recommended

If OH said "review in 3 months":

1. ✅ **Diarize review date** (set reminder now!)
2. ✅ **Monitor** attendance/performance during period
3. ✅ **Meet with employee** before review date to discuss how things are going
4. ✅ **Decide** if further OH review needed:
   - Adjustments working → May not need further OH review
   - Still concerns → Make new OH referral

---

### Step 5: Document Everything

**Keep records of:**

- ✅ OH report (file securely)
- ✅ Adjustments agreed
- ✅ Implementation date
- ✅ Review date
- ✅ Monitoring notes (how is it going?)
- ✅ Any issues or changes

**Why?** Evidence that you followed OH advice and fulfilled Equality Act duties.

---

### If You CAN'T Implement a Recommendation

**Don't just ignore it.**

**If a recommendation is not feasible:**

1. ⚠️ **Seek HR advice immediately**
2. ⚠️ **Document why** it's not feasible (specific reasons, not "too difficult")
3. ⚠️ **Consider alternatives** - Is there another way to achieve the same outcome?
4. ⚠️ **Contact OH** - Discuss alternatives with OH Advice Line
5. ⚠️ **Inform employee** - Explain why and discuss alternatives

**⚠️ Important:** If OH recommends an adjustment and it's **reasonable** under Equality Act, you **must** implement it. Failure to do so = potential discrimination claim.

**Seek legal/HR advice before refusing an OH recommendation.**

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Long-Term Absence - When to Refer?

**Situation:**  
Employee has been off sick for 3 weeks with stress and anxiety. GP fit note says "unfit for work - stress." No previous OH referrals.

**When to refer:**  
**Now** - ideally within **first 4 weeks** of long-term absence.

**Questions to ask OH:**
- Is the employee fit to return to work?
- If not, how long is absence likely to last?
- Are there workplace factors contributing to stress?
- What adjustments would support return to work?
- Is a phased return appropriate?

**What OH might recommend:**
- Phased return (e.g., 3 weeks graduated hours)
- Stress risk assessment
- Workload review
- Adjusted duties (e.g., reduce lone working, remove on-call)
- Continue with EAP/Able Futures
- Review in 3 months

**Your action:**
- Refer to OH via OHIO
- In the meantime, maintain regular contact with employee (weekly call)
- Offer EAP if not already done
- Do stress risk assessment if work-related

---

### Scenario 2: Frequent Absences - Is Underlying Condition?

**Situation:**  
Employee has had 6 separate short absences in 8 months (migraine, back pain, stomach upset, cold, migraine, back pain). Total 18 days lost. Trigger breached. You're concerned there may be an underlying condition.

**When to refer:**  
**After attendance review meeting** if pattern suggests medical issue.

**Questions to ask OH:**
- Is there an underlying medical condition?
- Is the employee fit for work?
- Are the absences likely to continue?
- What support or adjustments could reduce absence?
- Is disability a factor?

**What OH might recommend:**
- Investigation of migraine (possible triggers, treatment)
- Workstation assessment for back pain
- Adjustments (e.g., screen breaks, ergonomic chair)
- Consider disability (migraine can be disabling condition)
- Monitor for 6 months with adjustments in place

**Your action:**
- Refer to OH via OHIO
- Continue with return to work discussions
- Implement any adjustments recommended
- Monitor attendance after adjustments in place
- Review in 6 months (as recommended)

---

### Scenario 3: Employee Requests Adjustments - Are They Reasonable?

**Situation:**  
Employee has disclosed anxiety and has requested to work from home 3 days per week. Role is care assistant in residential home - requires on-site presence. Employee insists this is a reasonable adjustment.

**When to refer:**  
**Before deciding** - you need expert advice.

**Questions to ask OH:**
- Does employee's anxiety meet definition of disability under Equality Act?
- Is working from home a necessary reasonable adjustment for this condition?
- What adjustments would support the employee in this role?
- If working from home is not possible, what alternatives are recommended?

**What OH might recommend:**
- Anxiety may be disabling - adjustments required
- Working from home not appropriate for care assistant role
- Alternative adjustments: adjusted shift pattern, avoid certain shifts (e.g., nights), additional supervision, regular breaks, stress risk assessment
- Access to Able Futures (CBT for anxiety)
- Review in 3 months

**Your action:**
- Explain to employee why working from home not feasible for care assistant role

### Scenario 4: Return After Surgery - Phased Return?

**Situation:**  
Employee returning after 10 weeks off for hip replacement surgery. GP fit note says "may be fit for work with phased return." Employee wants to come back but unsure if ready for full duties.

**When to refer:**  
**Before return to work** - you need specific guidance on phased return plan.

**Questions to ask OH:**
- Is employee fit to return to work?
- What phased return plan is recommended?
- What duties should be avoided/adjusted?
- For how long?
- When can employee return to full duties?

**What OH might recommend:**
- Fit to return to work with adjustments for 6-8 weeks
- Phased return: Week 1-2: 50% hours, Week 3-4: 75% hours, Week 5: full hours
- Avoid: heavy lifting (>5kg), prolonged standing, stairs for first 4 weeks
- Gradual increase in duties as tolerated
- Review in 2 months

**Your action:**
- Agree phased return plan with employee (based on OH advice)
- Adjust duties as recommended (arrange cover for restricted duties)
- Confirm plan in writing (hours, duties, review date)
- Regular check-ins (weekly) to assess how employee is coping
- Review at 2 months (meet with employee, decide if further OH review needed)

### Scenario 5: Capability Concerns - Before Dismissal

**Situation:**  
Employee has been absent for 12 months with recurring back pain. Multiple OH referrals, all adjustments implemented (ergonomic equipment, reduced duties, phased return attempted). Employee still cannot sustain attendance. You're considering capability dismissal.

**When to refer:**  
**Before moving to capability hearing** - final OH opinion needed.

**Questions to ask OH:**
- Is employee capable of undertaking role (with or without adjustments)?
- Is there any further support that could be offered?
- What is long-term prognosis?
- Is ill-health retirement appropriate?
- Is redeployment to less physically demanding role medically advisable?

**What OH might recommend:**
- Employee is not capable of fulfilling substantive role
- All reasonable adjustments have been explored
- Prognosis: back condition is long-term and unlikely to improve
- Redeployment to sedentary role may be appropriate
- Ill-health retirement should be considered (refer to Pensions)

**Your action:**
- Explore redeployment options (if OH advises this is appropriate)
- Consider ill-health retirement process (with HR and Pensions)
- If no suitable alternatives, move to capability procedure
- OH report supports decision that all options explored
- Document thoroughly (you've done everything reasonable)

### Scenario 6: Pregnancy - Health and Safety

**Situation:**  
Employee (care assistant) is 5 months pregnant. She reports difficulty with manual handling and is concerned about risk to baby. She's had 2 absences for pregnancy-related back pain.

**When to refer:**  
**As soon as health concerns arise** - H&S duty to pregnant employees.

**Questions to ask OH:**
- Is employee fit for current duties during pregnancy?
- What duties should be avoided/adjusted?
- Is risk assessment needed?
- What adjustments are recommended?
- When should employee stop manual handling?

**What OH might recommend:**
- Remove manual handling (immediate)
- Risk assessment required (pregnancy H&S assessment)
- Adjust duties: light duties only, no lifting, avoid lone working
- Pregnant employees should not do any manual handling after 20 weeks
- Consider alternative duties (admin, supervision, training)
- Review monthly throughout pregnancy

**Your action:**
- **Immediate:** Remove manual handling duties
- Complete **pregnancy risk assessment**
- Adjust duties as recommended (find alternative tasks)
- **Do not include pregnancy-related absence in trigger points**
- Regular check-ins (monthly) to monitor wellbeing
- Plan for maternity leave

**⚠️ Important:** Pregnancy discrimination law is strict. You **must** accommodate pregnant employee's needs. Seek HR advice.
