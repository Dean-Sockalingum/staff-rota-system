**A:** Contact IT Support with your SAP number and employee details. They'll reset your account within 2 hours during office hours.

**A:** Yes, but book early and check with your manager first. Some restrictions may apply during your first 3 months.

### Q: What do I do if I'm going to be late?

**A:** Call your line manager or shift coordinator immediately. Explain the situation and estimated arrival time. Persistent lateness can affect probation.
