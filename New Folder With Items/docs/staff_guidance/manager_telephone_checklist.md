# Supporting Attendance – Manager Telephone Checklist

_Source: Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP). This Markdown version summarises the "Supporting Attendance – Manager Telephone Checklist" that accompanies the Staff Rota System._

Use this prompt sheet when you contact a colleague who has phoned in sick. Tick off each point as you discuss it and record any follow-up actions directly in the staff record.

## About their absence

- How are you feeling today?
- What is the nature of the illness or injury?
- When did the symptoms start and when was the employee last at work?
- Have they consulted a GP or other health professional, and are they taking any medication?  
  - If the absence is stress related, refer to the **HR Supporting Attendance** guidance and involve Occupational Health if appropriate.
- Are there any concerns about infection risk or the need for medical certification (e.g. fit note)?
- What is the expected or planned return-to-work date?  
  - Agree the next contact date if the situation is uncertain.
- Are there any adjustments or support that could help them return sooner (altered duties, phased return, temporary home working, etc.)?
- Confirm the best method for keeping in touch while they are absent.

## About work matters

- Is any urgent work outstanding that needs reallocation or a handover?
- Do they have access to shared drives, equipment, or keys that need to be collected?
- Check whether there are wellbeing or workplace issues that may have contributed to the absence.  
  - Signpost to Trade Union support, Employee Assistance, or HR colleagues as required.
- Remind the employee about sickness reporting expectations (daily calls, fit note submission, etc.).

## After the telephone call

- Update the sickness log in the Staff Rota System (or send details to the rota administrator) so cover can be arranged.
- Email HR using the current **Supporting Attendance** routes, attaching any completed forms or fit notes when received.  
  - Example mailboxes: `CRServiceHR@glasgow.gov.uk`, `HRsupporting.Attendance@glasgow.gov.uk` (confirm locally before sending).
- If the absence is likely to continue, schedule a follow-up call or welfare meeting at the agreed time.
- Remind the employee to submit a fit note if the absence lasts more than seven calendar days.
- File the completed checklist in the employee’s staff record for audit purposes.
